Hi!

A very quick email tonight as Chris and I stayed up late to chat with Lea and Mark about their chicken experiences! We have lots to think about now, but I think we have been set on the right track.

This morning the shrike was back when we returned from our dog walk, perched on the top the spruce tree overlooking the bird feeders. We had been planning to refill the bird seed, but decided to hold off as we didn't want lure our birds to their death! To our surprise as we watched, a flock of about five blue jays arrived and started harassing the shrike. I have heard of small birds mobbing birds of prey, but it was quite neat to see in action, and the blue jays certainly weren't small. I'm not sure why the blue jays mind the shrike so much, as I can't imagine it would prey on them. I have a whole new appreciation for the role that blue jays might play in the community!

Today's photo is an attempt to capture this morning's tree top action. Quite a challenge when your options are an old digital camera or a phone taking a photo through binocular, but Chris made it work.

Hugs,
Hannah
