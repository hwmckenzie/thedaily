Seuss and I spent the day hiking around Elk Island National Park in search of wild pig scat. It was a beautiful day and Seuss worked very hard. We (the humans) hiked 16 km. I expect Seuss went closer to 30. I think we will both be sore tomorrow, but hopefully our morning walk will loosen everything up. I spent a long time tonight trying to brush all the tiny burs out of his coat, but there are still lots to go, and despite a rinse at PetValu on the way home, he is pretty dirty. I expect there will be a more fulsome groom and bath tomorrow. I bought new and extra tasty treats at PetValu in anticipation of just this!

Today's photo is another one of Revi Rover dreaming about her next adventure. It was brought to my attention that the photo I used yesterday did not show off just how cute Miss Revi is. Also, for those concerned with the snow outside the window, yesterday's was a photo from last year. We don't have any snow yet, thank goodness!

Hugs,<br />
