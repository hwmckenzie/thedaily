Hi!

Happy (soon to be) New Year! Chris and I celebrated at home alone with our dogs by watching a New Year's comedy show online and a very strange movie. Seuss celebrated by eating a large amount of what appeared to be poop. I know this as I cleaned it up after he puked on the carpet. He is a sad dog! Seemed like a very fitting end to 2020!

But, I can't let the year end without telling the rest of the sheep story. After I gave up all hope of getting the sheep back, Chris went out with the binoculars and spotted them down our road past "the spring". This is a spot where a spring comes above ground and the locals have built a little shed for it. It is a popular spot as many people get their drinking water there, and there is also a geocache. It is about 1 km from our house! So, Chris and I set out in Chaser with a bucket of oats and no plan. When we came upon the sheep Chris tried to lure them in our direction with the usual song and dance, but with their heads filled with freedom, they didn't buy it. I don't think they quite knew what to do with the big wide world though. After watching another car drive up to them and pass (goodness only knows what the driver was thinking about us!), we realized that the sheep really didn't want to go into the deep snow in the ditch. So, Chris drove Chaser around behind them and then pushed them back towards me, stationed as leader with the oat bucket. In this way we slowly made our way the 1 km back home. At one point the sheep got excited and ran past me, but soon fell back. This was probably the furthest they have walked in quite some time, so I was glad they all survived the trip. Things were a bit touch and go getting back through the gate, but luckily Spray Paint had had enough of freedom by that point and went to the oats I left her, providing an example for the rest of the sheep. Both the sheep and I spent the rest of the day napping! I think we were pretty lucky the snow kept them on the road. If it had been summer, I don't think we would have sheep anymore.

Today's photo is of our next animal adventure: muskrat rescue. Chris saw this guy (gal?) on the road in Innisfree. I had read that muskrats sometimes go for walks in the winter if the pond they are living in freezes to the bottom. Well, we felt bad just leaving this guy on the road, so we decided to try to catch him, with the idea of dropping him off in the conservation area slough on the way home. Given the photo, I'm sure it won't surprise you to learn that we were not successful! He ran into a backyard and we decided that was a safe enough place for him. Probably best all around as I don't think our sheet would have held up well in the face of the teeth!

Many hugs, and best wishes for 2021!
Hannah
