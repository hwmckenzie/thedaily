Hello,

I am taking a break tonight from talking about chickens (though I promise our coop tour video is still forthcoming!) to talk about another project I am trying my hand at: sourdough bread! I am a little behind the trend I think, but have decided to see what it is all about. I am currently on day 4 or bringing my starter to life. I think we must have some good (or at least a lot!) of microbes floating around our house as it has already started to bubble, which according to Google seems to be a good sign. I am not quite sure when I can start using it to bake with (maybe after a week or so?), or how to go about using it. Also, it has an odd smell. Does anyone know if this is normal? Maybe this is why it is called "sour" dough? Such mysteries! Send along any advice and stay tuned for results from the test kitchen soon.

I was reflecting this morning as I was going about my routine after we returned from dog walking that I spend a good amount of my day feeding things. The dogs, the chickens, the sourdough, Chris and myself! 

Today's photo is from our walk yesterday afternoon. The dogs are very amphibious and really blend into the aquatic environment. This is at our dugout, which is a popular spot for canine wading. It is also where they re-apply their signature spring scent: eau de swamp!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
