Hi,

The most important thing that happened today is captured in the photo, so there is really no need to write anything else!

Today's photo is of the sheep finally making use of their lovingly constructed shed. Finally! There were quite a few photos of different sheep loitering around and coming and going from the shed. There was even one photo of Bold Sheep with her front hooves on the door frame as she reached up to inspect the doorway with her nose. I suppose since the sheep are suspicious of everything they need to assure themselves that the construction is solid. I'm glad they are finally using the shed as we are about to have another bout of cold and windy weather, so at least maybe now they will be able to take shelter out of the elements... Although I did notice some determined holdouts, so perhaps not all the sheep have seen the light just yet!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
