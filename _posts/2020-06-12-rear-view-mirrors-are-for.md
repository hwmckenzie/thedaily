Hello,

Well, today was quite the day! It started off with a bang (well, more like a small crunch) as me and a guy backed into each other in the UFA parking lot. Luckily it seems to be mostly paint damage. I didn't see him as I was paying attention to a pedestrian, and he said he didn't see me either... but clearly we were both trying to occupy the same space! Darn it! The rest of the day went by in a hectic blur. It was so unexpectedly chaotic, it was almost amusing. Though I am very glad it is over and hope it won't be repeated tomorrow. 

Before all this hecticness struck, Chris and I took the dogs to our favourite "drive to a road" walk. We came back with 100% of the dogs (four), 100% of the frisbees (one), and did not have any porcupine encounters. We did see a deer though, which makes our 100% return rate quite impressive! Our success was likely bolstered by some discipline that was meted out in relation to chasing of deer on our walk yesterday morning, in addition to the fact that the deer chose to run across the road in front of us, giving me a good view of all participants. 

Things are very green here now and the grass is growing at full tilt. We have decided to cut back on how much we mow this year, and are only mowing our pathways and around our trees. Today's photo is a shot Chris took looking out our loft window. I love how the grass waves in the wind. We'll see how we feel about the grass later on in the summer when it starts to close in on us! Maybe sheep will be our next farm addition!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
