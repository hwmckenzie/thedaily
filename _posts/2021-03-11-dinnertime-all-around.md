Hi,

The sheep are happy campers as their new bale of hay arrived this afternoon. I think they were starting to worry about their food supply. I saw one tasting a cardboard box we have outside with some fire wood in it. We've been giving them oats and pellets to hold them over, and also free range of the yard (our poor trees!), but I guess nothing compares to tasty hay. Even I was excited pulling some out for them tonight. There are all sorts of good-looking plants in there!

The sheep were not the only ones excited about dinner. I recently signed up for a Supper Club being offered by a nutritionist living in Winnipeg who I've gotten great recipes from in the past. She is testing out the Supper Club idea by sharing a menu of four meals each week, including a grocery list. Tonight we ate a "Thai inspired mango quinoa salad". It was very tasty and refreshing, and we even used frozen mango. If you want to have someone else make the tiring decision about what to eat for dinner, you can [sign up here](https://smart-nutrition.ck.page/4048ca05ca) and give it a try. Its free!

Today's photo is of Revi sneaking a front seat view to the activities of the sheep outside. Little did she know Chris was observing her secret use of the chair!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
