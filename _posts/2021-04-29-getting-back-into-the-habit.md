Hi,

It is sure tough to get back into the habit of writing!

Work has ramped up this week with the summer inspection season coming fast, and this means progress around the property has slowed a bit. The chickshaw is at a standstill, but I am hopeful I can get the siding and roof on soon. I did get the hardware cloth on the summer coop run tonight, so the chicks are getting slowly closer to moving outside. They are quite large now. Based on the differences in size and also my observation that some chicks have larger combs and waddles, I am going to predict that we have two hens and three roosters. I guess time will tell if I am right. Perhaps I will try to get a photo and then everyone can place bets! Despite the fact that they are loud, messy, and sometimes stinky, they are still pretty cute. At the moment they are all laying together getting ready for bed.

Our broody hen continues to brood. We did find a piece of broken egg in her crate, so something happened to one of her eggs but we're not sure what. Chris put the camera in the crate with her, so tonight we got to watch her stand up and move her eggs around which was pretty neat. 

Today's photo is of the chickshaw. Maybe this Sunday will be the day it is completed!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
