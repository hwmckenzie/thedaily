Hi,

For a change of scenery, tonight Chris and I went to the fire hall and did an inspection of two of the trucks. This is something we do regularly with our fire department to make sure that the trucks are ready to respond and all the equipment is where it should be. Since we aren't having practices right now in order to maintain physical distancing, we are only going in with one other person to check the trucks. It is definitely interesting to get to know the trucks better, though some things remain a mystery and since we were on our own we had to leave a few question marks on the inspection sheet.

Today's photo shows how the dogs have been spending their days working from home.
