A very wintry morning here today. Yesterday evening we had a fog warning, and by this morning all the fog had settled on the trees and coated them in frost. Oddly enough, the exact same thing happened last year at this time. I have photos from our dog walk on December 11 and everything is white and frosty, except for Seuss and his orange frisbee. Sadie and Revi just melted into the white coated forest!

Today's photo is of this year's Christmas cookie offering. For 2021, I included ginger cookies and vanilla sugar cookies with modernistic trees done in green icing (two yearly staples!). I also did shortbreads, this year's version included dried fruit and came in triangles, a shape which was inspired by Martha. I felt it took it up a notch over my regular square shapes. A new addition this year were the chocolate sugar cookies with vanilla icing snowflakes. Very pretty, but early reviews prefer the original vanilla sugar cookies with trees. Lastly I included some fudge. Not Grammy White's recipe and definitely not as good, but it did set, which is more than I can say of my attempt with Grammy's recipe last year! Note that the tastiness of the cookies can be judged by goodness seen seeping through the bags ;)

Hugs,<br />
