Hi,

Another tough day here. We enjoyed a nice dog walk, although Revi decided to head home early. The rest of us walked down to the marsh (slew), and enjoyed walking along the shoreline. This area is usually underwater, but this is a very dry year, and the shore was littered with snail shells. We checked out the beaver lodge, which is now quite a bit above water, and found the jawbone of a beaver. Quite impressive teeth! After a nice walk, we got home and said hello to Revi who was hanging out in the chicken area, and then continued on with our morning.

I started to realized something wasn't right when I went out to see what the rooster was carrying on about. I noticed that our yard fence by the chicken area was completely squished. I assumed a moose had decided to traverse it and not bothered to jump. I figured we'd get around to fixing it later in the day. I spent some time on the deck working on the Chickshaw. After a while, I happened to glance over at the chicken area, only to realize there was a moose lying on the ground by our fence! How did I miss that??? I carefully walked down until I saw its ears move, and then I went to tell Chris we had a bit of a problem. We did a bit more investigating together, and determined that the moose was still alive, but not moving at all except for its ears and eyes. So, we called Fish & Wildlife. Luckily they were in the area and were able to come by and take a look. They determined that the moose was in very bad shape. Not only from whatever happened to it when it went through our fence, but it was also missing all the hair on its neck and belly due to ticks. These tick affected moose are called "ghost moose" because without hair they look almost white. The officer confirmed that it should be euthanized, so Chris and I stood on the deck and watched as he dispatched it as humanely as possible. Two animals in two days. Nature is a cruel mistress.

Today's photo is from our walk yesterday morning. Our dugout is thawing quickly, but the nights are still below zero. Each time we cross it the ice is thinner. Revi had no hesitation heading out on the ice, and she ran all over without any issue. Chris also crossed the dugout along the side, and made it to the other side dry, but I think there were a few tense moments. I chose the dry land route around myself!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
