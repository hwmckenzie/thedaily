A gorgeous fall day here of +8Â°C! We had a lovely dog walk and the chickens roamed free for most of the day. After lunch I saw the delawares hunkered down in the grass sheltered from the wind and enjoying a good sunbath! 

Even though it was nice today, it has been cold enough over the last week or so to freeze the smaller ponds. This afternoon Chris and I went for our first skate of the year! We decided to branch out from our dugout, which is much diminished after the dry summer we had. Instead we went to a pond in a field near us that we walk around often. The ice was like glass, and the best part was we didn't have to shovel it first! Just amazing. Hopefully we'll get some more skating in this winter (we've already matched the amount of skating we did last year!). I think my skating skills are quite rusty and I might be in need of a new pair of skates which fit my feet a bit better. While living in Edmonton, I bought a used pair of hockey skates. I bought hockey skates so I could look cool, but in reality it is like wearing too tight wooden clogs with heels that keep giving out, threatening to tip you over backwards. For my next purchase I'm prioritizing comfort and going back to the figure skates I grew up in. I think I will pass on the cookie monster and blue bird outfits I recall wearing in my skating shows though!

Today's photo is of Chris testing out the ice.
