Our chickens are driving me a bit crazy. 

For the last week or so we have had a chicken living in the house. When I got back from Manitoba, we realized that our last leghorn was getting bullied, was molting, and was also suffering from pasty butt. She is about half the size of the other hens and things had gotten so bad that she had taken to hiding in the coop all day. One night when I went to close up the coop I found her hunkered down in a hole outside. Talk about a sad chicken!

In an effort to get her back in shape before the winter so she could reintegrate with the flock, we brought her inside and started giving her various treatments including nightly butt baths with Seuss's probiotic shampoo (I think I may have been sucked in by the advertising on that one!), udder butter on her comb (leghorn combs are not Alberta winter hardy), yogurt, and lots of scratch and sunflower seeds to help her regrow feathers. She seemed to be on the mend, and so we started putting her outside by herself in the Chick-frame during they day as we wanted her to keep growing her winter feathers. Things continued looking good and she has laid an egg for the last two days! We've also started letting her out with the other chickens (who currently have the run of our yard) during the day, and she sometimes spends time with the flock but always goes back by herself to the Chick-frame at bedtime. 

This morning when I took her out to join the flock, I noticed that right away Chief came over and mated with her. He does seem to do this, I'm not sure if it to "welcome" her back or what. But then, the light Sussex ran over right when Chief was done and pecked her right in the head! Well, that is just not on! It was not the first time I had witnessed such behaviour from the light Sussex either. So, with some scratch as bribery and some sneakiness, I managed to isolate the light Sussex in the Chick-frame, as I had read that you should try to isolate the bully for a while. Then when they return to the flock they aren't the top chicken anymore. I felt confident in my approach and secure in my disapproval of the light Sussex. 

However, this evening as it got close to chicken bedtime, I noticed the light Sussex frantically pacing up and down trying to get out of the Chick-frame and back to the coop with the rest of the flock. She seemed so distressed and so of course I felt bad for her! But she is also picking on the smallest chicken. Talk about conflicting emotions!

Today's photo is an homage to Stewart. Despite the fact that he got quite mean towards people in the end, he was a handsome fellow.
