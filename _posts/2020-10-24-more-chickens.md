Hello!

Well, I'm back home after a few days of hoteling it with Seuss while searching for wild boar scat. He is not a very good bed companion. He doesn't consider it necessary to orient himself like a human in bed, and so I end up sleeping at odd angles. He also doesn't need covers, and so he doesn't think to make sure I have access to any either!

I wasted no time getting back to work on the chicken coop today. All the rafters are done (and good riddance!). After lunch Chris and I wrestled the house wrap onto the roof and then added a bit of strapping, so hopefully it won't fly away overnight. I think tomorrow we should be able to put on the tin. Our friend from the fire department also came by and confirmed that I am on the right track with the window, so maybe we'll try to install that tomorrow as well. It is supposed to start warming up and be above zero during the days most of next week, so I am hopeful we can make some good, and more comfortable, progress!

And, not a moment too soon. Today we welcomed eight new birds to our flock. It was only supposed to be seven, but I guess it is hard to count when someone is handing you clucking and flapping birds! These are Delaware chickens, which are apparently a heritage breed known for being a good balance of egg production and meat. They also lay brown eggs, which will be exciting to try. At the moment they are in a dog kennel surrounded by straw bales inside the dog run. We are hoping this will keep them safe and warm tonight, and then the temperature is supposed to ease off a bit over the next few days. Once they settle in a bit we will try introducing them to our leghorns. When they arrived our rooster and hens all came over to check them out through the fence. Hopefully they can be friends and not pick at each other's feathers!

Today's photo is of our new Delaware chickens when they first arrived.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
