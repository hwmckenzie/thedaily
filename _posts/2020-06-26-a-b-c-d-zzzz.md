Hi,

I seem to be drawing a blank on what to write about today. I had an earlier than usual start to my work day, and a later finish than planned, so perhaps that has something to do with it. In any case, I have decided to write a few sentences about each of the "usual suspects", and then go to bed! So, in alphabetical order....

Chickens. We made our last visit to the neighbor's chickens tonight and topped up their food. Their chickens are getting quite feisty. The roosters must in the "show off to the ladies, fight with the boys" phase. The neighbors should be home by tomorrow night, so they can figure out how to keep the peace! Our own chickens are doing well.

Chris. Tonight Chris got his drone flying again for the first time in quite a while. After that he cut up watermelon which was quite tasty. Extra tasty when I get to eat it in little pre-cut cubes!

Dogs. Sadie and Revi are going through a major shed, so I spent some time brushing them. Unfortunately their hair is very light, so I also spent a lot of time trying to corral it into the garbage bag. I would have done it outside, but there were too many mosquitoes! Seuss smells the best after his bath last night.

Eggs. They are piling up in our fridge, so I am in dire need of some egg recipes. Ideally not ones that also use a lot of butter and sugar!

Frisbees. We used Chris's drone to try to locate the lost green frisbee after making a brief search for it on foot. The approach shows promise, but needs some refinement. It doesn't help that Seuss lost his green frisbee in a field of new green wheat shoots! Weather permitting, we will try again tomorrow.

Gardens. They are growing, but need some attention. 

Well, I only made it to G, but I think that covers the important items! Today's photo is courtesy of Chris's drone. It gives you a good idea of our tree shield. All the light squares are the hemp mats we put around the young trees.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
