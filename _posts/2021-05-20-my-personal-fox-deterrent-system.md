Hi,

Still chilly here, but things should warm up over the next few days. I looked out the kitchen window tonight to see the fox back and checking out the chicken pen. He/she was out of luck though as all the big chickens had already gone to bed. However, Chris went out to implement some preventative measures by scaring it off. The hollers and yells he made were quite impressive, particularly as he made them while running down the path after the fox in his sock feet! If I was the fox I think I'd look for another restaurant with less enthusiastic staff! We checked the fox-cam tonight, and unfortunately it doesn't seem to have gotten any pictures. We're not sure what went wrong, but we'll try again tomorrow.

Today's photo is of Seuss enjoying some illicit time on the couch. I had gone to chat with Amy and somehow Seuss convinced Chris he should join him on the couch! He left quite a lot of sand and grit and dirt, but he sure looks handsome!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
