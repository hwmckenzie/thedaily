Everyone knows the feeling of home. The familiar, what you come back to, where you can always find your heart. When it comes to trails, we have one like that. The Home trail. It starts at our house and takes you through grassy meadows, briefly down one little dip into a small forested ravine, and finally down into the conservation area valley. I think it was one of the very first trails we walked and it is the beginning and end of many of our dog walks. It is where I first lost Seuss (temporarily!) before we even lived at the property. We weren't the first to walk this trail and other creatures continue to maintain it and prevent it from being overrun with grass when we happen to walk elsewhere for a while. The whole trail is beautiful, but there is one special spot. At the end, just before you descend to the valley floor, you come up over a rise and have a view looking down into the valley and over a mature aspen/poplar forest. In the summer it is a dark and mysterious place. In the winter, the trees deprived of their leaves, you can look deep into the forest. I always hope I'll crest the rise and see an animal in that forest, but it hasn't happened yet. It doesn't matter if we're walking this trail leaving or returning to our house, it always feels like home to me.

You can see where the Home trail goes on [this map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1gDozj7lSCT-ClPu0kIHYFaE00KiF0sun&usp=sharing) I am making of our trails.

Today's photo is of Seuss in the dip along the Home trail.
