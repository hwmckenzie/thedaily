Hi,

I am not sure if it is just temporary, but it was practically spring here today! Quite nice for all two-legged, four-legged, and winged residents. I am continuing to make plans for the vegetable garden. The current focus is to get seedlings going for the veggies that need to be started indoors. I decided to farm out the heavy lifting for this step to Chris's mom and Lemonee, a high school student on our fire department. I think this is a good move because both of these gardeners have experience starting seeds and proven track records for success, in addition to the necessary lights. They also don't have any dogs, which I think greatly increases the chances of seedling survival! Lemonee is going to start our first seeds this weekend which will be for peppers, soon to be followed by tomatoes and eggplant, then brocolli, and finally cucumbers and melon. Marlene has taken on the various squashes, zuccinnis and pumpkins. As you can tell, I am adhering strictly to my goal of not overdoing it... not! 

Today's photo is of Revi enjoying the view from our loft window. Chris brought her up the ladder last night so she could sleep in the loft with us. Sometimes he does this for Revi and Sadie as a treat. While they both enjoy being up there, they dread the descent back down the ladder in the morning. Although Revi is on the bed in this photo, she gets her own dog bed on the floor for the night, as otherwise she would push Chris and I out of the bed!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
