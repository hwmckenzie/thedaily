Saturday is extra nice when you have the chance to take Thursday and Friday off as well. By the time today rolled around, I had already done some of the chore-type things and was well settled into weekend relax mode. This is the way to live! I am experimenting with some new baking to include in my Christmas cookie bags, so I made a few small batches of things for testing. Initial reviews are positive, though I'm not sure I have a very picky audience! We also got two eggs today for the first time in a while. One of our leghorns has been struggling for the last week or so and laying soft-shelled eggs. Today she laid a nice egg, so hopefully she is back on her game. Our easter egger hasn't laid in about two weeks. I did see a lot of feathers in the coop today, so perhaps she is doing a late moult? We've also noticed that her beak has an underbite. Looking at photos, I don't think this was always the case, and I wonder if she suffered some sort of trauma to her beak? We'll need to read up and see if anything should be done. I believe she is eating and drinking ok as otherwise I think we'd notice a bigger change, but maybe she isn't thriving enough to lay eggs?

I also wanted to add a bit to my post from yesterday. Sometimes after I sit down to write, I get a bit of feedback which makes me revisit what I wrote. Upon second reading, I'm not sure that the way my thoughts came across was really what I was trying to convey. I do think that many people, myself included, would choose to connect with friends and family, either in person, virtually, or through a card or letter, over receiving gifts. That being said, while I have been on a kick to get rid of stuff and bring less things into my life, I do appreciate when friends and family give me gifts. I value those things because they represent someone I care about who was thinking about me, which is something pretty magical. This is also why I enjoy giving people gifts... and hopefully I get them things they want to have around!

Today's photo is of some of the action at our bird feeder today. After a bit of a dry spell in terms of bird seed, this morning I filled all our feeders and the bird bath. This year we have a lot of chickadees. I stood by the feeder for a while this afternoon to get some photos. It was quite peaceful listening to the birds flutter around. Chickadees have to work hard for their food. From watching, it seems like they come to the feeder to get one seed, which they take back to a branch where they crack it before eating it. And repeat!

Hugs,<br />
