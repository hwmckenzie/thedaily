Hi,

With covid receding a bit, at least until the second wave, fire practices have resumed. I have mixed feelings about this. Now that we are in the habit of not going to practice, I wish we didn't have it. But, it is nice to see the people and I can definitely use the practice. There is a lot to learn. I was reflecting tonight that trying to learn things at our fire practices really puts into perspective how hard our team at my day job works to support the learning experience of the watercraft inspectors, ensure they feel confident, and have all the tools to be successful in their job. I can't say my experience with our fire department is the same. People mean well, but.

One thing I do I appreciate is not being responsible for taking the lead with the fire department. Tonight I stood back and observed. Our practice seemed to be about using this big collapsible tank, which lets us dump all our water into the tank so another team can spray it on a fire while we go to fill up again at either a fill station or a nearby slew. The initial dumping went smoothly. It really made me wish we had a tank like that for our property. We could set it up beside the deck and take refreshing dips on hot days... except it would take forever to fill with the garden hose! So, water dumped, my team headed to the fill station, where I watched as they proceeded to dump water on themselves from a giant overhead hose. Apparently there was some confusion about how to use the control pad and they turned on the wrong outlet. Being somewhat familiar with fill stations, I had tried to warn them, so was standing well back when it happened. Following this, we took turns spraying water out of the truck into the field. Next it was time to back the truck up to the tank and refill it. With the field thoroughly soaked from all our spraying, the truck made it just far enough into the field to sink in and get very stuck. Nothing to it but to use our other truck to tow it out... which is hard to do after you get it stuck as well. They (and I say they because by this point I was solidly on the sidelines) did manage to get both trucks out by using the winch of the last truck remaining on the road. So, with the sun setting we all piled into the trucks and returned to the fire hall. I wasn't sure if should laugh or cry, or both.  Suffice to say I think we could use a few more practices. Gear stowed, Chris and I high-tailed it home, put the chickens to bed, and had a hot shower. I am already imagining snuggling into bed myself.

Today's photo was captured by Chris during our practice. Quite striking. Almost as striking as watching a group of people drench themselves unexpectedly from above. Almost.

Hugs,<br />
