Hello,

We did lots of things around the house and property today, but of course the day went by much too fast, so lots of things still remain to be done. I guess farmers must feel the same way as it is nearly 10:30 pm and I can still hear the sprayer ripping up and down the field next door. I suppose the weather conditions for spraying are pretty narrow, so they have to take advantage when conditions are good. We won't walk the dogs over that way for a few days now to let all the chemicals disperse. I don't think the local farmers have read the book I've been slowly working through, "Weeds, Guardians of the Soil", so they still view these "undesirables" as the enemy!

There is something I keep meaning to write about, but then forget when I sit down at night. The chickens have been keeping us up! Now that it stays light out so late and the evenings are warmer, the chickens are staying up later and later. A few nights this week we found ourselves watching from the window and counting how many chickens were in the coop, then rushing out as soon as the last one climbed the ramp to close the door before another decided they would come out again! They do have a pen attached to their coop, but we haven't finished ensuring it is predator proof, so even if they are all in their pen, we are hesitant to just leave the coop door open for them. I am looking forward to the time when the fencing is finished so we can go to bed when we want instead of being held hostage by a bunch of fowl!

Today's photo is of Sadie looking out over her domain from the top of a grid of big round hay bales. Even though she is getting older, she is still very spry and jumped up onto the bales parkour style (they were taller than me!), and then proceeded to run around, bounding gracefully from row to row!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
