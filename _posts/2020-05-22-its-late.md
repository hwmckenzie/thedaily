Hello!

A very quick email tonight as it is quite late and the sleep gnomes are coming for me!

I actually almost forgot to write the daily email tonight. Gasp! The fact that I almost forgot tells me I must be distracted. Likely with work as things are really starting to move quickly with getting watercraft inspectors hired and stations opened. But, the fact that I remembered (which occurred when an odd sense of forgetting drifted across my mind as I was climbing the ladder for bed), tells me that writing this email has become a habit!

Today was still wet, but we got the dogs out for their morning walk, so everyone was happy. The chickens laid five eggs despite the chilly wet weather. Chris and I have big plans for yard improvements this weekend. So, everything is pretty much par for the course!

Today's photo is of me at the end of last weekend in a pose that is probably destined to be repeated this weekend! Despite appearances, I have not fallen victim to a horrible carpentry accident, but am overcome by the challenge of leveling the greenhouse. I wonder what this weekend's Herculean task will be?! On an optimistic note, Chris and I were triumphant in the leveling arena, so perhaps that is an auspicious sign.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
