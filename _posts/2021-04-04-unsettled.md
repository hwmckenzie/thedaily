Hi,

I'm not sure why, but today was a very unsettled day for me. We had our regular morning, although it was slightly delayed since we took a bit of time to get our chick cam going. After that, Chris headed to his office to dive into school, and I worked on my permaculture project. I did this all morning, and for quite a bit of the afternoon. This may have been the problem, too much sitting at the computer! I did make some progress, but for some reason it felt very unsatisfying.

We are also nursing an adult chicken. We're not really sure what is wrong with her. She is very sad, isn't eating, has a purple tinge to her comb, and has watery diarrhea. Things aren't looking too good at the moment, but we are making sure she drinks water and hoping she pulls through.

One exciting thing to report from today is that we spotted our first robins of the year! A group of about five was in our yard for a few minutes this morning.

Today's photo isn't very glamorous, but I thought you might enjoy seeing behind the scenes of our chick cam.
