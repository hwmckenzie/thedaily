A tough day here. The chicken we brought inside last night with the purple comb did not improve throughout the day. After consulting our chicken health book and a chicken group I am a member of on facebook, we concluded that based on her age and symptoms, she likely had a problem with her heart. Unfortunately there was not much we could do for her and her condition was deteriorating, so this evening we made the difficult decision to euthanize her. This is the second chicken we have performed this service for, and it doesn't get any easier. So, things are a bit heavy here tonight.

I had a neat experience on my afternoon walk with one of our wild bird species. The dogs and I had just finished hiking along the valley in the conservation area and up the hill back towards our fence. It was pretty slow going as it has snowed quite a bit since we last walked that way. Seuss and Revi did a good job of breaking trail for Sadie and I, though we all stopped for breaks. Well, I take a break and the dogs listen, sniff, and politely pretend they are busy taking in their environment while they wait for me to catch my breath! As we reached the top, two grouse burst out from the snow right in front of the dogs, surprising everyone. I was sure they had come from under the snow, and it turns out that I was right! I did a bit of reading on this [Nature blog](https://blog.nature.org/science/2014/01/16/the-grouse-in-winter/) and learned that when temperatures are very cold, ruffed grouse plunge into the snow and completely submerge themselves. While under the snow, their body heat creates a sealed dome which stays between -7°C and 0°C!

Today's photo is of our Delaware chickens right after they arrived in November 2020. After saying goodbye to our hen tonight, we are down to one remaining Delaware. I wonder how our sheep are doing?

Hugs,<br />
