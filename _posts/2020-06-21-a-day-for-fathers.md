Hello!

First of all, happy Father's day to all the dad's out there! I was reflecting on some of the memories I have of time spent with my Dad. It occurred to me that many of them involved creating, designing, or building things. It must be from my Dad that I inherited the habit of imagining a solution to some design problem I am facing while first ignoring practical constraints, and then figuring out how to make it work in reality. Of course, sometimes what we imagine turns out to not work as expected, or at all, but on average I feel we come up with some pretty unique ideas this way!

As day five of being on the road comes to a close, I am grasping for things to write about. I look forward to getting home tomorrow to hear what has been happening while I've been away. Maybe BB will be making progress on growing some new feathers! I am also looking forward to having a few days off with Chris to continue on with some of our projects and also to do a bit of relaxing... He will tell you that we don't usually manage to fit in the relaxing part, and he would be right! But, maybe that is something we should work harder to succeed at... which I realize is paradoxical!

I didn't have any recent photos in mind for today, so I've included a photo of Chris and I when we were in Chile in November. I am excited to be reunited with this guy tomorrow!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
