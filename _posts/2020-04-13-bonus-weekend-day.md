Hi,

Another day in the history books, and it didn't even feel like a Monday! Today was another full day of puttering around the house. It is amazing how the day can go by, full of doing just a series of small things. I think that whenever it comes time to retire, I won't have any trouble filling my days!

We have been thinking lately about what we will grow on our property this summer. Assuming we will both be spending more time here than is usual, we felt maybe it would be a good summer to finally have a vegetable garden. After watching the Biggest Little Farm, I feel motivated to learn more about permaculture methods, and to see if we can put any into practice here at our property. Unfortunately we are currently lacking a benefactor with deep pockets, which I am sure the documentary makers must have had. However, I did find  a short course online through Verge Permaculture, an Alberta-based company, at the right price (free!), so I will be working through that over the next week or so as a start. We are also very close to taking the leap and acquiring chickens! Sheep have also been discussed as a way to help keep our grass down, but that may be shearing off a little too much for one summer (groan!).

Today's photo is another one taken by Chris. We noticed the other day that the pussy willows are budding by our dugout. Chris got this neat photo while we were out for our dog walk this morning. The light was quite challenging as the willows were in shade but the sun was strong behind them. And Chris's phone helpfully decided to freeze midway through the shoot! All those challenges aside, he managed to get this very artistic shot.

Hugs!
Hannah
