Hi,

Not too much to report from the property today as I spent the day in Edmonton for work. We did brave the cold for a dog walk this morning before I left though. I have been having jacket challenges lately. While I have many jackets, none ever seems to be the right one for the occasion. Chris would suggest that I am on a fruitless search for the "perfect" jacket, and he might be right! This morning I opted for the giant work parka. Big mistake! It was great for the first half of the walk, but then I started to sweat. This causes my glasses to fog up, which in turn leads me to step off the trail, trip over small branches, and inspect the snow at close range. And it was so cold with the wind chill that I couldn't unzip it a bit to let out all the hot air without freezing. By the time we got back to the house it was all I could do to get inside so I could rip the thing off! I think I must suffer from overheating claustrophobia. And not only is it disappointing to end up wearing the wrong jacket, having so many different options to choose from also presents a challenge that must be confronted each day! Even as I write that, I am immediately thankful that I have an overabundance of jackets, recognizing that many people would happily trade their lack for this silly problem of having to decide which jacket to wear. That being said, I think I better remedy the situation somehow, and then I can donate the rest!

Today's photo is from an evening walk a few days ago. It is one of the two birch trees we have found on our property, aside from the ones we planted in our yard. Unfortunately these latter trees have been significantly challenged in their growth by the sheep. In any case, I think there used to be more birch trees here in earlier days as the conservation area next to us is called Birch Coulee. Now our property is primarily poplar and aspen, but perhaps over time we can bring back the birches.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
