Today was gray and overcast, with a strong hint of winter in the air. With freezing rain and snow in the forecast for the next few days, I convinced Chris that today was the day to put up the Christmas lights before it would become a hypothermia-inducing task. After five years of putting up the lights, we've got a good system and things went smoothly this year. One hour later we were inside enjoying some hot cocoa and baileys! For the last few years we've wanted to have some sort of tasteful light installation at the end of our driveway. With the house lights up, we have a few weeks before the "lighting of the lights" in December to brainstorm how to make that happen.

We also spent a bit of time in the winter coop making some adjustments. While there we noticed a sad delaware all fluffed up in a ball and not really doing much of anything. So, we've brought her inside for observation to see what the problem might be. There are a few others who could use some "udder budder" on chapped combs, but we have to wait until nightfall to catch them. So far the winter coop is working quite well. Best of all, it is done!

Today's photo is of the results of a small project I did a few days ago. Our woodpile was quite out of control. It got overgrown by grass over the summer and was at risk of disappearing in the snow with the coming winter. I didn't like looking at it, which was unfortunate as it is right in view from our patio door! After some inspiration from the internet, I fashioned what I think is quite a good-looking wood storage solution using two cinder blocks and some scrap wood. All that is missing is a fire and some marshmallows.
