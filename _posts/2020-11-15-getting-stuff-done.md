Hi,

A busy weekend for me. After the last few weeks of mad chicken coop construction and then the sudden snow, our yard had become a hidden and very messy construction site. A bit of a hazard for playing dogs! I spent most of Saturday uncovering wood and tools and putting it all away. This entailed a lot of trips down and back from the tent garage and the Pigeon Shed. By the end of the day I was feeling quite sore, but very satisfied. Our tub was full of thawing garden hoses and we had a large box of sand drying by our heater vent (for the chicken dust bath, what else?!), but I had reclaimed the yard and was one step closer to reclaiming my sanity!

Today I adjusted the chicken fence so the chickens have a spot where they can be outside, but which also keeps them in their area. This is good news for the dogs who now have their unsupervised outdoor privileges back! At least when the sheep are not out. The dogs are still not sheep safe, as Revi reminded us this morning by chasing the sheep while Chris was trying to make friends with them. A definite setback in interspecies relations all around. This evening Chris and I managed to roll the sheep's round bale into their pen, and then I wrapped it in snow fence. Tomorrow I will cut some hole patterns in the fence so they can access the hay by nibbling in some areas and also sticking their whole head in once they exhaust what they can reach by nibbling. Based on the internet, this should help them waste less. I guess we'll see how that goes. And now that the bale is in the pen I don't have to fret so much about whether or not I am giving them enough, or if they have enough if it gets cold overnight.

I also did quite a bit of tidying and organizing in the house and I feel like things are under control again. Sadly I am starting to worry that I have forgotten how to relax and all I can think of to do with my time are chores. A sorry state of affairs! 

Today's photo is of Seuss recovering after a very energetic play session with Revi.  Unlike me, Seuss and Revi have been playing a lot lately. They are also very good relaxers. Sometimes they even play and relax at the same time. They lay on the ground with their heads together and bite each other's faces and make horrific noises. It is a very good time!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
