Hi,

This afternoon I did something I have been saying I should do for a while, but have been putting off. It is one of those types of things that you procrastinate about or avoid doing, but then when you finally do it, it is so wonderful you question why you didn't just do it right away. In this case, the thing is wearing the snowshoes to go walking. Chris and I refer to our snowshoes as "the shoes". At the beginning of winter we are hesitant to put on the shoes as we are used to being fleet of foot without them all summer. And it is only just a little snow after all. Then at some point we start to find ourselves doing more slogging and the amount of snow, or the snow crust, starts taking away from the enjoyment on our walks. But still for some odd reason we resist breaking out the shoes. Two things finally pushed me over the edge this afternoon. First, the trails we have packed down are quite precarious and I have been stepping off the edge of the hard packed snow and sinking unexpectedly more and more frequently. The only thing worst than sinking in snow is having it happen unexpectedly! Second, because it has been so cold we have very few well packed trails and I wanted to walk somewhere new to change things up. So, this afternoon I strapped on the shoes, and experienced the joyful surprise as I do every winter of how wonderful it is to float on top of the snow! The dogs and I headed to the field and discovered that the snow is not as deep as I feared! The dogs did have to work harder than I did, not having any shoes of their own, but it wasn't too bad. I expect they are tired tonight, but hopefully they won't be too stiff tomorrow. Now that I've broken out the shoes, I'll be strapping them on for all my walks!

A quick note about the sheep. I think there is unrest in the flock. Chris and I observed quite the kerfuffle this evening. There was a lot of head butting, body checking, and general milling around. One sheep was bucking and jumping straight up into the air! I have no idea what this means or if the issue was settled, but clearly there was some sort of drama!

Today's photo is an example of what happens when you are trying to take artistic photographs while on a walk with the dogs. I thought I had a few moments to myself as everyone had gone ahead. Not so! By the time I sat down and composed my shot, my strange behaviour had been noticed and Seuss came back to see if this meant that I would throw his frisbee.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
