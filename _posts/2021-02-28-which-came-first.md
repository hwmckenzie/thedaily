Hi,

While Chris was studying hard and writing his exam, I spent the weekend working on my permaculture project. If you would like to read the newest post, you can find it on [The Property Report](https://propertyreport.upnix.com/). I have to warn you though, this one leans a little more towards the theoretical and dry. But, I have been working hard on a map as well which I will post later this week, which I hope will bring the whole process to life.

Today's photo is of some eggs we bought today. These eggs are not for eating, but for hatching! Chris found a farm near Vegreville that rents incubators and provides a dozen eggs of a mixed variety of breeds, so we thought we'd give it a try. According to the directions, we are to leave the eggs out on the counter overnight, and then put them in the incubator tomorrow morning. If all goes well, in 21 days we will have newly hatched chicks. We have a lot reading and preparation to do between now and then!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
