I've felt lately that my posts are turning into "what is Hannah up to indoors" instead of "what is happening on the farm". The dogs and I have been getting out for our two walks a day most days. But, the chickens have been taking care of themselves (or I should more accurately say that Chris has been taking care of the chickens!), so I don't feel like I have many chores to do outside. A big change from the summer with all the building projects and last winter with the sheep and double the chickens. I worry that this leads to a mundane blog, but maybe that is just what sanity feels like?

After several rounds of testing, I have started baking the final product for my Christmas cookie bags. Now the trick will be to get all the different cookies baked, and the bags filled, decorated, and delivered before we eat it all!

Today's photo is a flashback to this time last year. If you recall, it didn't take the sheep long to figure out how to get around my attempts to create a "waste-free" hay feeder. While the sheep did have their moments, looking at that photo reminds me that I might really enjoy having a little quiet time around here this winter!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
