Hi,

Today Seuss and I traveled to Cold Lake for the big opening day of the station. In spite of a whopper of a thunder and lightning storm last night, it was still hot and muggy today. Seuss was very patient while we completed all the orientation and final training of the humans, and he even got to inspect a boat and sit out on the grass with everyone at the end of the day. Now we are both relaxing in our hotel room in anticipation of more boats tomorrow.

Here is a [link to a video](https://photos.app.goo.gl/CgvfGq86LKJx8GZt90) of Seuss and I searching a boat at the end of May which returned from the US with mussels. We went to sniff the boat when my colleagues were completing a decontamination to kill and remove the mussels. It was a good training opportunity for us and Seuss did great. What a dog!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
