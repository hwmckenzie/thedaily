This morning Seuss got caught up in some deer tracks and led us on a merry chase. Though I should note, I didn't feel very merry at the time! We had walked down to check out the slough, and were about to turn around when Seuss lost his frisbee. His search took him a little further, and then a little further, and then so far that his light disappeared. At this point I started to question if he was really searching for his frisbee after all! After a few hollers, I pulled out our trusty Tractive app to see where he was, which turned out to be heading off across the fields! So, up the embankment I scrambled to reach the open field in hopes of spotting him. This might have worked, except that my scramble up the slope was impeded by steepness, snow, bushes, and  my own two feet! Sadie, hot on my heels, did much better having four legs, a lower profile, and superior running skills. Chris, attached by leash to Revi who is still recovering from a similar solo adventure, opted not to follow. A wise choice as I expect he and Revi would still be tangled in the shrubbery as I write this. Instead, they headed for home to get Chaser as Sadie and I plunged after Seuss. Of course as luck would have it, his Tractive battery was low and soon became critical. With limited time to get to him before he went into stealth mode, Sadie and I hustled along, with me alternating between gasping and yelling. A few minutes after receiving a final location from Seuss, Sadie and I stopped at the edge of a stand of trees and I accepted the truth that Seuss was going to be the one to find us and not the other way around. So I rallied my failing lungs and sent some more hollers, and a few curses, out into the crisp morning air. And lo, he appeared! A Christmas miracle! Expressions of relief and admonition complete, the three of us followed our tracks back towards the road where Chris was waiting with Chaser. But, Chris had a surprise in store. As we came out of the trees and prepared to cross the field, there was Chaser, hundreds of metres from the road and completely at home! The benefits of all wheel drive, good clearance, and a husband willing to put them to the test. A true triumph for Chaser!

Today's photo is of the two dogs currently enjoying the status of "good dog" in our house. While Sadie and Revi like each other just fine, I think only the draw of the best bed in the house could entice them to get this close to cuddling.
