Hi,

The chickens are causing their caretaker some consternation. This morning Chris took some zucchinis out to the coop in the hopes of brightening their day. When he checked back at lunch they hadn't made much headway on the zucchinis. So he cut one open to show them how tasty it was. While they seemed to enjoy it, they still hadn't made much progress by this evening. Also, the Stop-Pick chicken, while not bloody, has lost more feathers on her back. We could not identify any obvious culprit and we're not sure what our options are for keeping her from getting picked on. Then, at dinner we noticed that the temperature in the coop was spiking, so Chris had to go out and plug in the fan we have in there. The chickens had unplugged it, for the second time this week! To cap off the day, I had given him a pair of my old work coveralls to wear while working in the coop. They are a bit tight though, and when he brought the eggs in tonight one got squished in the pocket! It's not easy taking care of chickens!

Today's photo is of my very big, tough, and brave Seuss, taking up residence under my desk because snow was sliding off the roof. He is a big dog and I have a small desk, but he made it work!

Hugs,<br />
