Hello!

Well, I almost missed sending out the email tonight! That is what happens when you get out of the routine I guess. Seuss and I are in Medicine Hat for the next few days doing our annual dog refresher training. Normally this happens with our trainers in California, but not so this year due to Covid. The three Alberta teams are all together and we are going to try to have our trainer join us via Skype... Should be interesting. If I was her, I would be worried about getting seasick as we try to have her follow us around on our searches using our phones!

This morning before I left, Chris and I stopped on our walk to check in on our neighbor's chickens. They texted yesterday to say they were going home to Quebec for a visit, and would be very grateful if we could make sure the food and water they left was sufficient. It was neat to see their chicken setup. They have a much larger population than we do. They started with chicks in April and they are teenagers now, but not laying yet. They definitely look younger than our hens. I'd describe their look as "gangly and wide-eyed". They also have some roosters, which look quite different than the hens. We even got to hear a few practice crows from them as they tested out their adolescent voices!

Today's photo is of Seuss and I when we first met, five years ago this week. We both look much younger! It may be five years ago, but it still feels like yesterday, although we have matured in our relationship a lot. For example, we can now confidently take the elevator in hotels if we want instead of having to sneak up and down the back stairs, and we don't bark when people walk by in the hallway outside our room... well, to be clear, I never did bark at that (or anything else!).

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
