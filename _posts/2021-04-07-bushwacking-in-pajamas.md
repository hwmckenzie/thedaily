Hi,

I am writing this blog post while taking a break from chicken tracking. One of the two marauding Delawares was not able to figure out how to get back through the fence to her coop tonight. She has been pacing in the conservation area near the house all evening and has so far resisted rescue attempts. After crashing around in the bush for a bit looking for her, in my pajamas no less, I have just located her hunkered down in a tuft of grass. Unfortunately she realized my initial attempt to grab her and set up a big racket and threatened to run away. Stewart responded from the coop, but I guess he wasn't bothered enough to get out of bed to come get her. So, now that I know where she is, I have retreated to the house to wait until it gets a bit darker. Rotten chicken!

Sad chicken is almost back to normal. We put her outside in the big dog run for a bit today and gave her a butt-bath tonight. If she seems ok tomorrow morning I think she'll be ready to rejoin the flock. 

Chris started cutting up the fallen spruce tree today. So far he has cut all the branches off, but we are not sure what to do with the trunk. Seems a shame to cut it all up for firewood. It would make a lot of nice sitting stumps, but we don't really need any. I suggested making some side tables, but this idea didn't find much support. I admit, they would be very sappy side tables! So, we decided to sleep on it. I fed some of the spruce boughs to the sheep and they seemed to like them.

Today's photo is from an evening dog walk a few weeks ago when we still had snow. Now I'm off to grab that darn chicken!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
