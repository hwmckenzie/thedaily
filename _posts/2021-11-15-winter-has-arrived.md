As the title says, the snow arrived today. It started late this afternoon. The dogs and I squeezed in our walk just as it was starting to snow. There was a good layer on the ground before it got fully dark, and I can hear it blowing out there now as I sit inside our cosy house. Seuss and I are supposed to meet Heather and Diesel at Elk Island tomorrow for some more searching, so I guess I'll have to put on a coat and toque and toughen up! 

No progress with our delaware house guest. She isn't very active and doesn't seem to eat or poop much, which I always see as a bad sign. Tomorrow we are going to try to do a more thorough exam.

Today's photo is of Sadie enjoying the first winter wonderland walk of the winter.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
