Hello!

Chris and I continued today with our regular activities. We are enjoying the easy walking through the crop field, currently in stubble state. It is easy both because it is nice to walk on, and because it is possible to see the dogs over long distances, so I don't have to yell at them quite so often to tell them "too far"! We are doing as many walks on the fields as possible, as once the crops are planted we won't be able to walk there anymore and will return to the conservation area, which will be very leafy in a month or so. Those walks will require many, many, many more "too fars"! We circumnavigated a small lake and were treated to the sight of a (quite large!) beaver. Sadie also spied the beaver, but decided she didn't feel like swimming after it. Lucky for me, as last time she swam after a beaver, I had to swim after her!

As is our routine these days, we continued work on the coop. The main coop is now 100% enclosed! Next we will tackle fencing in the run area (which includes making a door), adding the wheels (some design considerations still to work out there), and painting. Current projects for completion are sometime this weekend.

Today's photo is of a mixed flock of geese taking off as we walked through their field.

Hugs,
Hannah
