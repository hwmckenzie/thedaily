Hi,

A hot day here in southern Alberta. Seuss is enjoying his morning and evening walks. They are filled with ground squirrels, which pop up unexpectedly out of tall grasses, scurry across the prairie with their tails raised like flags, and then disappear mysteriously down holes. All the while leaving tantalizing trails of scent in their wake. Seuss is beside himself!

Today we spent some time at the inspection station. The station here is quite different from the two I usually work at up north. It is co-located with a commercial vehicle inspection station right along the trans Canada highway, so lots of traffic, and the prairie landscape is quite striking in its flatness. There weren't too many boats today, but I expect tomorrow will be busy with people heading home after the weekend. We did still get to do a few inspections though and today's photo is one my K9 teammate Heather took of Seuss and I at work. Seuss is testing out his new "Swamp Cooler" coat, which is designed to keep him cool by reflecting solar rays and also through evaporation (as you get it wet). He seemed to like it, and it did feel cooler in the space between the swamp cooler coat and his fur coat.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
