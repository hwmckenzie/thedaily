Not too much to report today as Seuss and I were again away from home sniffing at Elk Island. We did put the finishing touches on the winter coop tonight when I got home though, so it is all move-in ready for tomorrow!

Today's photo is of Seuss reading a wonderful new book we got, in which he and his buddies Diesel and Hilo feature! In fact, Diesel made the front cover and Seuss got to be on the back cover. There are lots of great stories about dogs just like Seuss helping to protect plants, animals, and the environment and I'm looking forward to reading all about them. And I'm so proud of Seuss for being so famous!

Hugs,<br />
