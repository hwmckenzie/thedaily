Hi!

I believe we might be on a down swing of the farming ferris wheel. The day started out fine with a nice dog walk. Lots of action around the fields. After our walk I worked until about 3pm and then I started working on the roof of the sheep shed. Unfortunately before that we lost another chicken. Chris happened to be looking out the door and saw a lot of unhappy chickens and possibly something large and fast moving over by the office shed. He ran out in his sock feet, but whatever it was had gone, and we could only find four hens and our rooster. So awful! Indeed only five chickens are tucked up in the coop tonight. I am hoping that tomorrow we will be able to move their coop into the yard and this will deter what I assume are coyotes or foxes. We also went down to visit the sheep. They seem to be doing fine, but ran off as soon as we showed up, adding in a few high flying kick jumps for good measure. We did get a round bale of hay delivered for them tonight by our front field neighbor, so at least their winter rations are taken care of. Despite the animal challenges, I did make good progress on the shed roof. I made my first rafter today! It wasn't as hard as I thought it might be, but then I haven't installed them yet and when I line them up there is some variation between rafters... hopefully it is all within the margin of "square" of the shed overall!

Today's photo is of Chris and I on our walk this morning. I wanted him to capture us and the picturesque hay bales in the fields. I think he did well, though it was quite bright in our eyes at the time. And looking at the photo I am surprised (as usual) at how short I am in comparison to Chris!

Hugs,
Hannah
