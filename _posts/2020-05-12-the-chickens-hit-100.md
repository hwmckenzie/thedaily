Hello!

A short email tonight as I spent a lot of time working on the [March Property Report post](https://propertyreport.upnix.com/). A labour of love!


I will share a few quick updates though. Today we hit 100% egg production for the first time, with all five chickens laying an egg! Quite exciting, but now we are under the gun to start eating more eggs as our two egg cartons are now full. The sourdough bootcamp bread turned out alright. In the end it was fennel, apricot, walnut, cranberry, mozzarella bread. I think the weak link was the mozzarella, it needed a stronger cheese. And it was quite dense, but did have some rise to it, so there is hope yet for a real sourdough loaf in the future. Also, as a side note, the gingerbread is better on day two and is growing on me! We enlisted one of the younger volunteer firefighters on our department to pick up some gravel for us from Vegreville today which we hope to use this weekend to assemble our vegetable garden beds. When he left our place he told us he was heading to Vermilion (the other nearby town) to pick up a washing machine for another member of the department, so we are keeping him busy!

Today's photo is of my bread, by request from my mom!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
