After two days of morning to evening summer coop renovations, the chickens moved in this evening. The major update involved placing the coop on a more solid base to allow the wheels to be permanently in position so the coop can be moved every few days to new pasture. It still takes both Chris and I to move it, but I added a new lifting bar which will hopefully allow us to move it with more ease, although it still gets bogged down easily in long grass. I also tuned up the pen, which involved adding chicken wire on top to prevent aerial attacks and escapes. I removed all the nest boxes, which in the past have turned into sleeping and pooping compartments since they were higher than the roost. The new nest boxes are the same milk crates we used in the winter coop, so hopefully the chickens will find them familiar and we won't have any interruption in egg laying. It was quite easy to transition the chickens over. They were very excited to get out of the solarium, and immediately began eating all the fresh green grass shoots which are poking up. It was quite cute to watch! I sprinkled some scratch in the summer coop pen and called them over. As soon as I left, they went to check it out and I was able to close the pen behind them. They've been up and down the ramp to check out the coop and they seem happy with the new accommodations. Riblet was quite taken with the new view of the chickens and caused a little panic in the flock by chasing them around from outside the pen. This got her banished to the house until we have a few minutes to teach her more appropriate chicken watching behaviour. 

With the chickens moved into their summer quarters, I can shift my attention to getting the chick-frame ready for the baby chicks, and getting the solarium converted to a greenhouse. There is no time to waste as I know any day now Lemonee is going to call to see when I will come to pick up my vegetable seedlings. While I was finishing up the summer coop, Chris changed Chaser's tires over, so everyone is getting ready for summer!

Today's photo is of the chickens settling back into the new and improved summer coop. Hopefully this will be the last time we make modifications!
