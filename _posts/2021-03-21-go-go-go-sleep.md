Hi,

We had a very busy day of putting our house, yard, and animals in order, so we're about ready to fall into bed!

The chicks got a modification to their accommodation today. We replaced the chicken wire on the top of the half-kennel with the kennel top itself. This renovation occurred after I happened to look over at the brooder to see a chick perched on top of the chicken wire looking back at me! The little fluffball had launched itself at the wire ceiling and popped right through it. So, to avoid having any chicks go splat on the floor or ending up in a dog's mouth, we hastily fortified their home. They are already growing and becoming quite active. They are quite loud as I write this, so hopefully they continue their routine of going to bed once we turn the lights off.

Tomorrow Chris and I are heading to Calgary for an overnight! This is all part of me needing to return one work vehicle in Calgary, and pick up another in Edmonton. Chris will be chauffeuring me from Calgary to Edmonton, so we get a night away out of the deal! Luckily for us, Marlene will be coming to stay at our place to care for all the animals. Of course the forecast for tomorrow is a winter storm, which always seems to happen when I try to return my work vehicle!

I also posted a new [Property Report](https://propertyreport.upnix.com/) with the next installment of my permaculture project.

Today's photo is of Seuss watching over the chicks, pre-brooder renovation. We have also moved the kennel up a little higher so Seuss can't see in anymore. I think the chicks miss their Seuss, but we are happy as he was getting a bit too nosy for my liking!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
