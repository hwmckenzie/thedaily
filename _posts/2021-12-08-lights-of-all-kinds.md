I was surprised to find that today was Wednesday. Already halfway through the week. On Sunday, Chris and I headed to Edmonton for a little trip to see the Christmas lights at the Alberta legislature. 

Our first stop was to drop off the dogs at the kennel. This was achieved as smoothly as possible, which it turns out is not very smoothly! Our country dogs, already excited by their car ride, were quite overcome by all the doggie smells between the car and the kennel entrance. Sadie proceeded to smell every snowflake, Revi bounced up and down, and Seuss tore back and forth along the path in high gear. You can imagine what this meant for the humans on the other end of the leashes! We did finally make it through the door, at which point we practically threw all three leashes, suitably tangled, into the arms of the waiting staff member, and fled. I was recounting this story to a friend in town today and expressing some mortification about our dogs' unruly behaviour. Her comment of, "but you're so good with dogs!", has quite inspired me to re-institute some basic practice for our dogs in how to behave. Classes start tomorrow!

The dogs taken care of, we headed to Marlene and Ron's, where Chris spent the afternoon providing computer support, and I spent it drinking tea. This lovely afternoon was capped off with a very tasty dinner, after which we headed to our hotel downtown. 

On Monday we enjoyed a relaxing day of doing not very much of importance, and capped it off with a walk around the legislature to take in the lights. 

On Tuesday morning we rescue the dogs, who were suitably ecstatic to see us, and headed home. It was a good few days away.

Unfortunately, while Chris and I were enjoying our little mini break, Ron's daughter Jackie's family was having quite a different few days. Jackie's husband Dave, father to Malcolm and Justine, passed away very unexpectedly and suddenly on Monday. A brutal reminder of the preciousness of life. Hug the ones you love today, and tomorrow, and every day after that.

Today's photo is of the lights and the Christmas tree at the Alberta legislature. They were quite beautiful and well worth the trip to see.

Hugs,<br />
