Hi there,

Another day, another garden bed filled! For some reason filling the bed seemed to take less time tonight than last night. There was a casualty though. I inadvertently chopped the tail off a tiger salamander with my spade. They burrow into dirt piles, and Chris and I have performed a few unintended amputations over the years while moving dirt around. I felt very badly. Luckily I think the chances of it surviving are good. According to Google, tiger salamanders can regrow various body parts, including their heart and brain, so a tail should be no problem! I did stay away from that area of the dirt pile during the rest of my digging though as based on experience, they burrow in groups. So, only one more box to fill (in the greenhouse)!

A few other animal updates today. Two new birds arrived. We spotted two hummingbirds and a male red breasted grosbeak. We put out the hummingbird feeder, so hopefully we will see them again. It is definitely pretty slim pickings for flowers at the moment!

The dogs had a good day, as usual. For the last few nights we've had to call Revi in to go to bed, and she is always a very long time coming. We suspect she may have a den somewhere. So, tonight we put the Tractive on her in the hopes of figuring out where she is hunkering down. But of course it rained a bit so all the dogs were ready to come in early and go to bed. Therefore, Revi's secret layer remains safe for now.

Today's photo is of the greenhouse progress. I may have gone a little crazy with the mulch on top of the beds, but I am trying to take all possible anti-weed measures! Hopefully by the weekend all our heat loving plants will be installed in their new home.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
