I had grand plans for what I was going to accomplish before heading to Calgary for watercraft inspector training on Thursday. Not surprisingly, the "to do" pile is still larger than the "completed"!

One thing I did do tonight was to start my polyculture experiment. This summer I am going to try growing [Ianto Evan's Polyculture of Annual](https://pfaf.org/user/cmspage.aspx?pageid=349#six) in the beds which were previously in the greenhouse. The idea is to sow many plants together which are of different sizes and grow at different speeds, thus they are able to take advantage of all the different niches and also provide a long harvest period. The first step is to cover the beds in 1-3" of compost. I did this tonight, and marveled at the rich compost which Chris created through a lot of sweating which turning and watering it last summer. It didn't say to in the instructions, but I put the straw mulch back on top, as I'd bet my last dollar that if I didn't grass would have taken over by the time I get back! I also put up some dog deterrent fencing. When I get home it will be the May long weekend, and I will take the next step.

One little rain cloud did show itself on the horizon of my summer garden plans tonight. I have been watching the solarium over the last day or so, and it is dawning on my that despite being so named, it may not be as sunny in the summer as I anticipated. I'll have to think more about whether the greenhouse plants will do well there or if I need to come up with a different plan.

Today's photo is of the freshly prepared polyculture beds. With the main motivated for the temporary fence looking on!
