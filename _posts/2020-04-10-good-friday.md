Hello,

The Easter weekend is here! The day started out gray, windy, and snowy (typical Good Friday!), but turned out to be sunny and warm. Currently all the dogs are snoozing after their big afternoon of watching us work outside. It is nice, but maybe a little eerie, like the calm before a storm. The storm being when they all wake up full of energy just as we are about to go to bed! After being inside in the morning, Chris and I spent the afternoon cutting off branches infected with black knot (a.k.a "poop on a stick") from our trees. Luckily we don't have too much of it, but there is one area of our yard which has a lot of cherry species and suffers from the black knot. After we cut it all off we burnt the branches right away, so we are really making good use of our fire ring in 2020! Chris also used the loppers to take out a few offending caragna bushes, though I think it was more a shot across their bow rather than to make a dent in their population. That will be a battle for another day! In the meantime, tonight's plan is to relax, watch a movie, and eat leftovers.

Today's photo is of Seuss supervising our black knot removal. This particular tree suffered the worst of the infection. Hopefully our efforts put a dent in the knot for this year at least.

Until tomorrow,
Hannah
