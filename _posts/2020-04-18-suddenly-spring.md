Hello!

Well, spring has come, and I am realizing it is a classic case of "be careful what you wish for"! Suddenly there are thing to do all around our property. Chores that we could not have done a week ago are suddenly begging to be done now! This of course corresponds with the start of our permaculture course tomorrow. Although the goal of this course is to implement a design for our property which will help it take care of itself with less work from us in the long run, I'm quite sure that getting there is going to require, you guessed it: work!

One thing we did today was settle on a design for our chicken coop. We found it on the internet, but I am not going to share the plans with you. That way, whatever our final product looks like, I can claim that was the original goal! I will say that after our chicken chat with Lea and Mark, we have decided to start by purchasing a small number of one year old hens. This way we can enjoy eggs right away, as if we got chicks now they would not be laying until near the end of summer. And, like many things in life, we figure we'll enjoy it more if we can reap some rewards early on! After spending today planning and surveying our available building materials, construction is scheduled to start tomorrow.

Today's photo is of Revi, enjoying the outdoors with nary a concern in her head for things like chores! There is probably a lesson for the humans to be learned there...

Hugs,
Hannah
