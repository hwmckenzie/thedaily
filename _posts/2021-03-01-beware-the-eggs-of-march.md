Hi,

I can hardly believe it is March already. Today felt like a very odd day. We started out with a bit of a different morning routine, as Chris attended a virtual tour of the National Museum of Computing, just north of London, hence the early morning timing! So, the dog walk was postponed until this evening. I'm not sure if it was the dogs or I who were more out of sorts about this deviation from the routine. Once I finally got settled, I  was working away when I happened to gaze out the window, as one does from time to time when one is engaged in the less than exciting task of data entry! Well, what did I see but the sheep meandering by. This was a bit of a surprise as I did not let them out this morning. But not too much of a surprise as we did notice a few days ago that part of their fence had blown down. I guess they noticed as well! I did a few repairs at lunch, so hopefully there are no repeat escapes. We enjoyed a very long dog walk this evening down one of the roads that doesn't get much traffic. Now all the dogs have gone to bed, and I expect the humans will follow soon!

Today's photo is of our eggs in the incubator and all set to start their development. We turned the incubator on this morning, and then briefly opened it this afternoon to add an egg from one of our delawares. It is much bigger than the other eggs, but I took this photo before we added it. If we are lucky maybe we'll get to see what a delaware crossed with a leghorn looks like! So far everything looks good. Apparently in 5-7 days we should be able to see veins if we candle the eggs. Fingers crossed.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
