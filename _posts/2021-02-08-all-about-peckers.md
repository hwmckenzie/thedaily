Hi,

Greetings from the polar vortex. We continue to spin around the sun, granted the illusion of sunshine but without any heat! I feel quite lucky to have a warm house to hunker down in. We took the dogs for a short walk this morning and I did a quickie with them tonight. Other than a few animal chores the rest of the day was spent admiring the outdoors from indoors.

Our bathroom is once again home to a chicken. We had to bring in the same chicken who was getting her tail feathers pecked at a few weeks ago as someone spent their afternoon picking on her and things were looking quite bloody. We got her cleaned up and tomorrow before she goes back out we'll paint her liberally with Stop-Pick. Chris also identified one chicken with a bloody beak. We have put a zip-tie on her leg so we can identify her in the future. I guess we'll have to figure out what to do if we find she is a regular culprit. Hard to keep the peace around here!

Today's photo is of a very rare visitor to our bird feeder. A pileated woodpecker! I was quite lucky to be passing by our door when this guy was there. I hope he or she comes back. 

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
