Hi,

Not too much to report today, so I'll just share the photo. Here are the dogs out on our walk before dinner. I'm not sure what Seuss and Revi were looking at, but at least I had Sadie's attention! Even though it is cold (and about to get colder!), I can feel the days getting longer. Hooray!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
