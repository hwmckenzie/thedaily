Hi!

Well, Seuss and I are on our way home... but paradoxically this first involved going further away. After training in Lake Winnipeg for a week, we headed to Kenora (Ontario) to do some searches in that area. At one of the locations we met a member of the lake stewardship group and she shot some footage of Seuss searching, of me talking about Seuss, and of my boss Cindy talking about the program. It seems that 2020 is the year Seuss gets to be a movie star. Good thing he wakes up every day looking naturally handsome!

It was neat being back in Ontario, even if we only dipped our toes into the western border. We didn't get to see any red maples, but the fall colors were still quite beautiful. It was also great to be back around Ontario lakes! I felt quite nostalgic. All that Canadian shield rock and the conifer trees right down to the water sure makes for pretty lakes. If there had been a canoe nearby I might have hopped in and paddled off with Seuss for a few days of relaxation. It was also nice to be in the same province as my friend Amy, even if only for a few hours.

We are currently just outside of Winnipeg. Tomorrow we'll be in Regina, and then after one more search on Thursday morning, I am hoping I'll be back in my own bed on Thursday night.  And then I can return to reporting on things such as the winter coop progress, the whereabouts of the sheep, and who knows what other property projects. 

Today's photo is of a classic Ontario lakeshore, of which I have many fond memories from my childhood! It would sure be great to spend some time somewhere like this during my adulthood.

Hugs,
Hannah
