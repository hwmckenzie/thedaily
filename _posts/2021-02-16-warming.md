Hi,

A balmy day here today! Chris opened the chicken door in the afternoon and several of the chickens took advantage of the opportunity to get some fresh air. If the forecast proves to be correct, the chickens will have at least a few more nice days to get outside this week. I enjoy looking at the forecast a little more these days. Not only because it is more encouraging in its overall predictions, but I'm no longer greeted by a bright red bar across the top proclaiming the extreme cold warning! And my face can feel the difference when I go outside!

Chris and I took a walk today without the dogs to look for anything that would shed light on the cause of death of the coyote. Nothing conclusive. I'm not sure where that leaves us in terms of our confidence that the dogs are safe running around the conservation area. My gut tells me that the chances of there being traps set in there are quite low, but the consequences are so dire that it gives me pause.

Today's photo is from our morning walk a few days ago. We had stopped so Chris could take the batteries out of one of our trail cameras. One moment our driveway looked quite unremarkable, and the next the morning sun was lighting up the trees. 

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
