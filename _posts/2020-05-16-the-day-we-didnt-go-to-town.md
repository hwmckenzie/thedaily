Hello!

A lovely Saturday here at the property. Originally we planned to go to Vegreville to pick up a few things at the hardware store as well as some groceries. But, this morning on the dog walk we decided not to. The weather was spectacular, and we were imagining a lot of people and lineups in town now that things are starting to open up, and being the long weekend. So, we decided that we'd just stay home. Best decision ever! We started working on our garden boxes. Not the fancy ones made of the beautiful wood delivered by Marlene and Heather on Friday, but giving new life to the ones we used at the lake way back in 2014. These will go in our greenhouse, and we decided they would be a good warm-up for the more serious garden box construction in our future. We made good progress assembling them, but got a little bogged down when it came time to level the area where the greenhouse will go. There is much more of a slant over the ground than you would think from looking at it. So, we did a bit of planning, but left the dirt moving for tomorrow. We finished off the afternoon with some wood chipping. We have cut down all of the caragana in our yard with the help of some young guys on the fire department, and are slowly working through chipping it. It has opened things up nicely and now we can appreciate the other trees, mostly Manitoba maples. We have plans to plant a food forest of sorts in the spot just by our house where most of the caragana was removed. After their walk this morning, the dogs spent the day lounging around the yard watching us work and keeping an eye on the chickens. Not a bad life at all!

Today's photo is off my first loaf of sourdough bread! It was quite a success! I did feel that making them (in fact I made two!) was a bit involved, and heated our house up quite a bit midday, but the flavour was amazing. Much more nuanced than other bread I've made. I have some started in the fridge now, so we'll see if I get into a bread making routine.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
