I haven't written much lately, but I do think about my blog quite a bit. Hopefully in my 41st year (yikes!) I will find some time to sit down and write about what is happening more often. After all, at this point if I don't start writing it down, I'll forget it!

Seuss and I got home about a week ago from our America road trip. Hopefully over the next little while I can write some updates about what's been happening here. Certainly spring is coming so I expect there will be lots of action.

I did finally write the last post from our California trip, so you can read them over on [The Property Report](https://propertyreport.upnix.com/) if you are interested.

Today's photo is of (most) of the dogs out on our walk this afternoon. Seuss and Revi way out in front with Riblet following and Sadie and I brining up the rear. This is a good depiction of how much snow we have left, and there is less each day!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
