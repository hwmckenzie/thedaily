Seuss and I are enjoying being back home after a week away in southern Alberta for some training. I always feel a bit out of sorts when I get home from being away, so today was very low energy. However, despite this and the fact that there is still lots of winter left, I have been thinking about spring planting and summer property plans. Not wanting to wait, I decided to start an indoor winter garden. This was in part inspired by my uncle Bob's success with his Aerogarden. Since he's been tending it, he's raised tomatoes, lettuce, and a variety of herbs. For my indoor cultivation efforts, I decided to try sprouting. I have memories of my family doing this when we lived in Ottawa, and in fact, the sprouting kit that Marlene lent me is exactly the same as what we used! I started my first sprouts today, so if all goes well Chris and I, and the chickens, will be enjoying some fresh greens in the near future.

Today's photo is of the tiny seeds enjoying their first rinse!

Hugs,<br />
