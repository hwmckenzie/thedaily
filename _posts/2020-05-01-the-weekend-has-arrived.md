Hello there,

It is Friday night and all humans, dogs, and chickens are settling down for bed and looking forward to a good weekend! 

Although today was mostly just a regular school/work day, there are a few things which might be notable enough to recount here. We had a nice walk this morning and then I made some quick cinnamon buns to enjoy with our morning coffee and kickstart the workday. As of tonight only one lonely bun remains. This is simultaneously a testament to their tastiness and to the perils of working from home! After work, Chris and I went to Vegreville to get groceries. While there we got take-away pizza for dinner and ate it in the car. Date-nigh out in the time of covid! So, we are now all stocked up on groceries and I am set to convert ingredients into meals, and then into energy, which we will use to finish the coop... and address all the other spring chores which have been piling up while we toil on this coop! Speaking of the chickens, I think everyone is ok, but when we put them to bed tonight we noticed a good amount of blood spattered around their run. They were all cosy in their box, and no one seemed the worst for wear, so we suspect it may just be that someone cut their cone and then flicked blood everywhere. We'll take a better look in the light tomorrow. We're also wondering if they are suffering from bugs, and maybe scratching a lot? We are going to try to set them up with dust bath tomorrow, which we are learning chickens use to rid themselves of parasites. So much to learn, we'll need to spend some time this weekend reading our chicken book.

Today's photo is of Tammi and Revi enjoying their car ride to the post office with Chris this afternoon when he went to check the mail. They think life is pretty good!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
