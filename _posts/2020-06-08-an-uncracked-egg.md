Hi there!

We have good news to report about Barebutt, or "BB" as she has been renamed. After several days in our bathroom, she laid a good hard shelled egg this evening! So, tomorrow we will give her a bath to put her feathers back in order, and once she is dry, we'll reunite her with the flock. Hopefully they welcome her back with open wings. Chickens can be a bit mean I am starting to realize, so I am slightly worried about that. We're very glad that she has pulled through whatever issue she was having. In retrospect, it may have been in the range of normal, and we locked her up in our bathroom for naught! Hopefully she keeps improving and also grows new feathers. In any case, the timing is good as I will need to turn my attention to one of our other hens who has decided to sleep in one of the nest boxes at night! This is an annoying habit as she poops in there every night as well! Based on our chicken book, it sounds like this behaviour can be discouraged by putting up curtains on the box, so maybe this week I'll break out my sewing machine. Honestly! These chickens!

Today's photo is of Tammi patiently listening and waiting for the mouse she knows is in our old well pump to come out. Her focus was interrupted by the breakfast bell, so we never did see the mouse.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
