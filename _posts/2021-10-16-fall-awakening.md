It has been over a decade since I was in school, but the fall still evokes a strong "back to school" feeling for me. It is a little different now though. My summers are so demanding. Instead of a return to routine or a feeling of buckling down after a footloose summer, the arrival of fall now brings a sense of relief. A easing of the grind. And a sense of loss. All those summer moments missed.

I spent three weeks this fall with Seuss and the K9 team on a road trip to Manitoba and Ontario in search of invasive mussels. Seuss found plenty of mussels (even some underwater!), and I found a part of myself that had been lost. The part which knows how to slow down and take pleasure. To see beauty. The part that lives in the moment and does not fret about to-do lists. It was just a glimpse, but I remembered. So as I watch the migration pass over our house this fall, I feel awakened. Inspired to reconnect with myself, my surroundings, and my friends and family. Because connections are really what matter, and they are vital.

*Postscript*. Many things did happen at the property this summer, and I feel some responsibility to catch everyone up and document them for posterity. So, for the next few days I am going to share a story and photo from each month.
