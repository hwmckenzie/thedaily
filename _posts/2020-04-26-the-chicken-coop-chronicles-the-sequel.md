Hello!

Day two and all chickens are still alive! They might be more robust than I am giving them credit for, but being new chicken owners, we are being very careful until we learn more. The weather this morning was not very nice, quite windy and a few drops of rain on and off. Every time we peeked into the dog crate in the van to check on the chickens, they seemed content just to stay in there out of the wind, so we returned to the house to hunker down with the dogs, who also seemed to have settled into their lazy "bad weather day" mode. It seemed unlikely we would be able to make any progress on the coop today.

However, after lunch the wind died down a bit and the sun came out, so we set up the temporary chicken run and got all the hens outside. Before leaving them to return to work on the coop, we trimmed their nails. Yesterday Chris had noticed that they had really long nails, and as a result their toes were twisted and it seemed like their balance wasn't very good. After a bit of web surfing, we concluded that long nails is not a normal state of affairs for chickens, so we found some directions for trimming them. Turns out it is just like cutting dog nails, which I have lots of experience with, living with 16 paws! So, clippers in hand off we went to perform some animal husbandry! Chris was the chicken catcher and holder and I was the nail trimmer. Overall once caught they were much calmer and more stoic about the whole affair than the dogs... with the exception of one hen who caught me off guard when she tried to peck me!

Much progress was made on the coop today, but much remains to be done. I hope that tomorrow night the chickens will be all settled in their coop... and since I've said that for the last two nights, perhaps the third time will be the charm? Here's hoping!

Today's photo is of Chris catching the chickens for their pedicures.

Hugs,
Hannah
