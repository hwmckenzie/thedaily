Hi,

Well, the sheep are still roaming loose in our yard, but I think we are making progress! I am currently taking some vacation from work, so I am tackling some of the fall "farm" tasks. First on the list is securing the sheep in their pen. To this end, this morning I lured the sheep into their pen and then set up camp on top of the ladder with the binoculars to see if they would show me their exit strategy. It was neat watching them graze, but they were keeping their cards close to their chest. After about an hour I decided to take a more active approach. I got a bucket of oats and sang my sheep song to see if I could get them to come out of their pen. It took a while, but eventually Bold Sheep demonstrated the technique which involves slithering under the fence. It looked quite effortless actually! Before the others could come out I went into the pen and poured some oats in their feed dish, at which point Bold Sheep scooted back under the fence and into the pen. With this information in hand, this afternoon I purchased some wire which I am planning to string along the bottom edge of the snow fence in the hopes of preventing it from being pushed out by escaping sheep. If that fails I will then try to peg the fence to the ground along its length. I am determined that those sheep will stay in their pen! I expect in the spring we will consider putting up some more permanent fencing in our yard, but at the moment we're not sure how we want to arrange our various pens so we can rotationally graze whatever animals we have, so we are hoping to stick with the temporary (and more cost effective) snow fence.

Today's photo is of our driveway. Fall is truly here and the colors are beautiful.

Hugs,<br />
