I'm not done the next trails post yet, but it doesn't matter as we had something more exciting happen at our house tonight. 

We got a puppy! Not ours and not to stay, a foster puppy. Chris has been volunteering with SCARS (Second Chance Animal Rescue) for a while now, and it finally happened that we succumbed. Riblet is a 4 month old pup of unknown history. She is very friendly and quite chill for a puppy. Unfortunately she is suffering from a skin condition called demodectic mange. Demodectic mange is caused by *Demodex canis*, a parasitic mite that lives in the hair follicles of dogs. All dogs have some of these mites, and don't have any problems as long as they have a good immune system. Sometimes in puppies the immune system doesn't develop properly until they are about a year, and then the mites can cause skin irritation and hair loss. Because of this, poor little Riblet looks older than her years and a lot like a bald shar-pei! She arrived with an array of sprays, shampoos and pills, which will hopefully get the mites under control so she can scratch less and her hair can grow back. So far she has settled in quite well. Revi is excited, but also shows some signs of being a bossy big sister. Seuss is taking the puppy in from a distance and I think might not be entirely sure what to make of her. Sadie has retreated to her bathroom sanctuary for now, but will have to face the fact tomorrow that the puppy is here to stay for a while. I am curious to see how much work I manage to get done tomorrow. I had planned to take the morning off to enjoy yoga, so I guess we'll see how that goes!

Today's photo is of Riblet settling in.
