Hi,

Well, sadly BB never showed up, so we are left to imagine the worst. Poor BB! Since we don't want the same fate to befall any of the other chickens, we have been keeping them in their pen since the disappearance. They are not impressed with this situation, and cluck disapprovingly whenever one of us walks by. So, to prevent a chicken uprising, we have come up with another solution. A rooster! Chris read that a rooster will take care of the flock by keeping them together, warning them of aerial attacks, and sacrificing himself to protect the flock if needed. Quite a gentleman! Luckily for us our neighbors across the road got quite a few leghorn chicks, and many turned out to be males. So, Chris picked up a rooster today (who brought a lady friend with him apparently!) and is currently working on integrating them into our flock. Of course I am away with Seuss in Slave Lake and am missing all the action! Chris also sent me a picture from our bedroom window this morning of the sheep grazing contentedly just in front of our deck. It seems that they now come and go from their pen as they please. Quite disconcerting! 

Today's photo is of our newest additions. I guess our chickens were interested at first, but quickly moved on to other things. I'm waiting with anticipation for Chris to let me know what time this guy crows tomorrow morning!

Hugs,
Hannah
