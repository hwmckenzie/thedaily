Just a quick note tonight as we are ready for bed after spending the weekend catching up with things following our return from vacation. Our fans (aka the dogs!) were very happy to have us back. They spent the weekend reminding us of how much they like spending time with us and how much they like to be as close to us as possible, ideally touching. I think I am starting to relate a little to famous people in that it might not always be desirable to have your fan club trailing around after you as you go about your daily activities. I think that is the only way in which I might relate to famous people, and even that is a stretch! It need not be said that I missed the dogs as well and am happy to have them all back home with us. Now that Riblet has joined the pack, Chris and I are outnumbered two to one, with four paws for each human foot!

Today's photo is from one of our trail cameras. A very handsome fox out for an afternoon stroll!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
