Hi,

This morning we helped our final basement chicken move out to the coop. Although she wasn't 100%, she was well on her way and I think just getting out of the basement might help. With all the other patients gone it was getting lonely down there. All the chickens are molting right now, and she in particular was regrowing a lot of feathers. Luckily it is supposed to be warmer over the next few days, so hopefully they will have some nice afternoons outside in the sun. The sheep threw some hay on the ground and turned their noses up at it, so I moved into the chicken run and it was a big hit. They are also partial to grapes, which Chris has been taking them for treats. Yesterday we added the window shelf, the new flat panel oil heater (hopefully quite fire safe), and tidied up all the various cords for the heater, the heated waterer, and the cosy coop. It is like running a second, smaller, house.

Today's photo is of the chicken coop looking all tidy and cosy. The chicken in the nest box is unimpressed with the photo shoot as she wants some privacy to lay her egg.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
