Hello,

I've been listening to Outlander on audiobook as I drive Seuss around to all of his searching and media appointments. At the moment, I am in the midst of the American revolution. I've realized that I really enjoy historical fiction. In fact, I recall reading and enjoying a historical fiction about the War of 1812 when I was young. And Dianna Gabaldon is just such a fantastic writer. I could re-read/listen to her books endlessly and enjoy them more each time. She has a lot of strong female characters, to which I find myself aspiring. In any case, she also supplied me with the perfect word to describe the weather today, which is "mizzle". The kind of fine drizzle you might experience in the Scottish highlands, which doesn't seem like much rain, but which soaks you almost instantly! Our poor chickens didn't seem to realize it was raining and remained outside in the mizzle most of the day. As a consequence, they are now quite bedraggled and have retired to bed.

She also quotes quite a lot of literature and poetry in her writing. Much of which goes over my head I admit. However, I found myself feeling a bit sorry for myself today (likely on account of the mizzle!) and was thinking tonight of the line "no man is an island." I have to admit, although I am familiar with it, I had never actually read the poem by John Donne from which it is extracted. Tonight I did google it (you can read a modern version of it [here](https://web.cs.dal.ca/~johnston/poetry/island.html), and was surprised to realize that instead of being about isolation, it is in fact a reminder of how interconnected we are. The universe sends you what you need when you need it I guess, right?

No progress on the solar panels today on account of the rain. They are scheduled to come back on July 2 if the weather is good. I tried making yogurt from some fancy Bulgarian yogurt starter I ordered online. After 6 hours it still looked like milk, so I added some yogurt from the grocery store and now it seems to be thickening up. I can only imagine the bacterial wars going on in my instant pot! Hopefully Chris and I will be able to enjoy it tomorrow and won't suffer any ill effects!

Today's photo is of the dogs on a walk this time last year. They are consistently enthusiastic, rain or shine, and it is usually contagious!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
