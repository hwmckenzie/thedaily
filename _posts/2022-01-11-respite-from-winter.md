We are in a heat wave! A high of +6Â°C today. Two-leggeds, four-pawed, and feathereds all rejoiced. We enjoyed a much longer walk than usual this morning and nobody's face or paws froze. We opened the chicken door for the first time in about 2 weeks and by mid-morning they were outside scratching in the solarium. Even our patio door is much happier! With everything melting, we are crossing our fingers that most of the snow melts off our roof. There was a bit of a buildup at our gutters. Some did come off today, but hopefully the rest will come off tomorrow. Seuss and Sadie do not like the snow coming off the roof. Revi does not see what all the fuss is about. 

I also took a leap tonight and ordered the reasonably priced heirloom yogurt starter with the exorbitant shipping cost. I ended up ordering "European style heirloom", so we'll see what that's like. The same company also sells sourdough starter, and I noticed one with yeast which was from Melbourne Australia! Amazing what you can get on the internet.

Today's photo is of the sunrise this morning. You can just tell it is going to be a warm day!

Hugs,<br />
