Today was a windy gray day, which later turned into a windy gray and wet day. This meant a break from winter chicken coop renovations. In addition to remodeling the interior, Chris has been working on an upgraded ventilation system (including dust filtration!), and I am adding on a solarium (I just couldn't help myself!). But, on the plus side, a solarium only needs to be framed, and I am good at that part! It is almost done, it just needs to have the roof covered. Even though Chris and I again feel like we are in a race with winter, in fact we are currently ahead of schedule compared to last year. This time last year the coop had no windows or doors!

Anyway, since it was a quiet indoor type of day here, I thought I would write about an upgrade the human house got this summer. We now have an awning over our deck! It was clear we needed something to shade our deck as in the summer it is scorched earth out there. After much agonizing about shade sails vs awnings, we settled on a retractable awning and found a company in Edmonton we liked. They came out at the beginning of August and we picked out our color options. While Seuss and I were away at the end of September, they came back and did the installation. We haven't really had a chance to test it out since right now we'll take all the solar rays we can get, but I am looking forward to sitting under it next spring. It can be angled down as well, which will allow us to use it to shade the east side of the house, hopefully keeping things cooler in case we get another heat dome next summer. Early reviews from the dogs are mixed as it flaps around in the wind, which Sadie finds disconcerting.

Today's photo is of the awning at full extension. This photo was taken on September 30 at 2:15 pm by Chris's drone. It is surprising to me how much sun sneaks under the awning. However, by the end of September the altitude of the sun in only 33° above the horizon, whereas on June 21 it is at 60° degrees. I am hoping this will translate into the awning providing more shade earlier in the summer when we really need it. The solar calculator tool I used to calculate these altitudes ([link](https://www.suncalc.org "SunCalc")) also reminded me that on June 21 we got 17+ hours of daylight! By comparison, today we only had 10 hours. Hmmm. I am missing summer already and it isn't even Halloween yet!
