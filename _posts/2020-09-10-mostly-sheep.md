Hello!

Seuss and I are back home from what might be our second last work trip this year... at least that I currently know about! After a cold spell in the weather, the last few days have been very summery. We have a lot of tomatoes that are ready to be picked, and even some of the larger varieties are ripening now. The sheep are currently in their pen (woohoo!) and we have plans for a handler and sheep dog to come next week to hopefully collect them in a smaller pen/chute (which need to build) so we can get a good look at Spray Paint and also perhaps deworm them... which seems to be a thing you should do, though I haven't read the details about it yet. Chris has also read that trimming hooves is a sheep husbandry task, so we need to learn about that as well. We are also getting close to completing the sheep shed.  I just need to read about how to make the roof.

So, lots happening over the next few days!

Today's photo is of Revi and Sadie checking up on the harvest progress. Harvest is definitely in full swing here. Soon we'll be able to walk the dogs across the fields again once the crop is off.

Hugs,
Hannah
