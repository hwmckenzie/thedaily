Hi!

I am finally sitting down to write at the end of this slightly crazy week!

After the big snowstorm on Monday, Chris and I managed to get away for our trip to Calgary on Tuesday. Marlene arrived to look after all our animals with toys and treats in hand. Needless to say she got a warm welcome from the dogs! Even though it was just one night away, and involved a lot of driving for Chris and I, it was really nice to go on a bit of a trip. We returned on Wednesday just in time to enjoy a tasty dinner of dumplings prepared for us by Marlene before heading to fire practice. Thursday morning saw me up early and headed to Edmonton for a meeting. By the time I got home in the afternoon, Chris was out on a fire call, so I went to the fire hall to help them clean up when they got back. Thank goodness today was the start of the long weekend! Except not for poor Chris who spent the day working on his classes. I spent the day working on the next permaculture post, which I hope to have up this weekend. All about our vision for the property! We are both hoping to get to bed early tonight after a week definitely lacking in the sleep department.

The chicks continue to grow. Last night we upgraded them to a big wire dog crate, so today they spent lots of time zooming around. They are good fliers/hoppers and explore the world by pecking everything. They have quite a few feathers now and also appear to be getting their combs. It is fun to see them develop chicken behaviours. They now scratch and peck the ground in search of food, and stretch their legs and wings the same way the adult chickens do. We also made them a small perch tonight and they have all tried it out. They will be real chickens in no time!  

The outdoor chickens are driving us a bit crazy as there are several who regularly escape. Today they were really in the bushes along the conservation area, so hopefully they all make it back to the coop tonight. Stu/Stew was beside himself trying to call them back. He is unable to chase them down and bring them back as he doesn't fit through the fence, poor fellow!

Today's photo is of the chicks in their new home. It looks a bit different now than in the photo as we had to add some higher siding. It turns out they are still small enough to squeeze through the bars of the cage, as Chris found out about 15 minutes after we put them in there. I was having my shower before bed and brought the chick into the bathroom to show me we had a problem! Luckily it was Chris and not Sadie who brought this to my attention!

Hugs,<br />
