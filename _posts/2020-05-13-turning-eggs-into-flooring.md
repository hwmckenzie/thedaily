Hello,

A very short email tonight as I did not start writing early enough and it is time to go to bed! So, I'll skip writing about today, but will still leave you with a photo. 

Today's photo is of the baker's dozen of eggs that the chickens are using to pay for the new flooring in their coop! It was suggested to us that putting down vinyl or linoleum flooring in the coop would make it much easier to clean. Not having any spare flooring laying around, I went to Toma Fine Floors in Vermilion and asked if they had any "economical" linoleum flooring. When the owner asked what I was planning to use it for, I had to divulge that it was for our chicken coop. He seemed very amused and my sense was that this answer was better than anything he might possibly have anticipated! He told me to come into the back and he dug out a section of flooring in the right size that must have been leftover from a job, and gave it to me for free! So nice! We then had a nice discussion about farming and the beef industry, and how it is becoming a monopoly. This merged into a discussion of his life growing up on a farm with ten siblings, and how he used to work after school milking the cows and get up at all hours of the night in snowstorms during calving season. The conversation finished with him recounting to me how he told his son that if he (his son) had to work on a farm like he (his dad) had, everything would die because he (the son) spends all his time on his phone! If I hadn't been in a bit of a rush to get to work, I think I would have really enjoyed chatting with him more. Maybe I'll have the chance tomorrow when I drop off his eggs!

Anyway, the chickens will be very comfy on their new vinyl floor, featuring a wood plank pattern!

Hugs,<br />
