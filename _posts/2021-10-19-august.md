In August we realized just how dry this summer was. The grass, normally a dense waist high ocean of green, was already starting to die off. The dugout was the lowest we've ever seen it and surrounded by muddy flats. Many farmers cut their crops early after poor growth. While we had almost no mosquitoes, there were plenty of wasps (not my favourite!).

With the sheep gone and the chickens reduced, things quieted down quite a bit. I built a new model of chicken house, which I call the "Chick-frame". It is meant to be moved to new pasture everyday and you can collect the eggs and close up the coop from the outside with a pulley system, which is very handy. We also constructed a new feeder and waterer, these only having to be filled every few weeks, which vastly reduced our chicken chores. I like the Chick-frame quite a bit, but I have decided that it is too small for the number of chickens we have, and so the chickens have since moved back to the original summer coop.

Today's photo is of the Chick-frame. For those wondering what Chief Chicken looks like, this should give you a bit of an idea. He is much bigger now and quite handsome.
