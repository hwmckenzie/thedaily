Hi,

Well, we tried our best to just relax today and not to eat too many leftovers all at one. I think for the most part we managed it, though Chris did do some school work, so maybe I was the only one relaxing! All is quiet on the animal front.

Today's photo is of Revi relaxing by the tree. Note that this is not a dog chair! One moment she was standing next to the chair looking out the window, then she had her front feet on the chair (all the better to see out the window of course), and the next thing I know she's reclining as if she's been there all day. In the end I just let her enjoy it. I must be getting soft!

Hugs,
Hannah
