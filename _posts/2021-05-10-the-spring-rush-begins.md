Hi,

Spring is definitely here and things are speeding up around the property.

Yesterday Chris surprised me with my birthday present, which arrived all the way from Ontario! He got me a bench and installed it on the top of our hill. So, now when I hike up there I can sit down on my own bench and look out over the fields.

I also finished the Chickshaw with Marlene's assistance. Yesterday we moved it into the chicken's current area. They have investigated it, but so far no one has tried to sleep in it yet. I think tomorrow we will move the chickens in there once they go to bed and see how that goes. It will be great to get them shifted over as then Chris won't have so many chicken chores to do. It is designed with a mesh bottom so all the poop just falls on the ground, so they fertilize as we move them around.

I also picked up all my seedlings from Lemonee. They are currently on a shelf in our living room, waiting for a bit warmer weather to move outside. They are also waiting for their home to be constructed! We are making some adjustments to our greenhouse. I started tonight be building a larger garden bed area. Chris helped me move it into place, so the next step is to level it (my nemesis!) and then to cover the ground with cardboard to stop the weeds and grass.

Today's photo is from one of my dog walks. There is a tinge of green as the leaves are starting to come out on the poplars!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
