Hi,

I realized there are a few updates I forgot to include yesterday.

For one, we have at least one rooster in our flock of baby chicks. We know this because we have started to hear what I think pass as practice crows coming from the summer coop in the mornings! So far I believe it is just one bird. So perhaps this means the other four are hens! Or just that any other roosters are late bloomers? 

This next update wasn't so much forgotten, but occurred after I wrote yesterday. Chris and I were waiting for the big chickens to go to bed, so we could go to bed. There was one hen who just wouldn't go into the shaw. All of a sudden there was a big stir with much clucking, and when I looked out, all the chickens who had been previously tucked into bed were milling about outside! I went out to share my frustration that they were not in bed, only to find there was a fox right on the other side of the fence! It ran off as soon as it saw me, but I'm quite sure if we hadn't added a layer of chicken wire over our farm fence it would have been right in there selecting the fattest looking hen!

This morning we checked the fox cam. There were indeed lots of cute videos of baby foxes. We counted at least seven. Unfortunately the way it is set up, you have to play each video to save it, all while standing on the side of the road and using cellular data. So, this afternoon we brought it back to the house and reconnected it to our wifi network... which sadly deleted all the cute videos! So, we will try again tomorrow. 

Today's photo is of something we found along the fence in the sheep's winter area. Looks like they were using the fence to rid themselves of their winter coats! They still have quite a bit to shed and at the moment they are looking a bit funny. I have also realized they are smaller than I thought, once you account for the winter coat!

Hugs,<br/>
