Hello!

A long day of driving for me today. Myself and two colleagues drove down to the small town of Enchant from our storage location to pick up some equipment and shuttle it back up north. We had good weather, and not too much road construction, but geeze it was a long day. My poor butt is numb from all the sitting! The most memorable part of the trip for me was when I (Hannah) stopped in the town of Hanna and ate a Hanna burger from the local burger joint. As Chris pointed out, I was also wearing my jeans from Mark's Work Warehouse which are of the model labeled "Hanna". Quite the convergence of Hanna(h)s!

I returned home to find that the greenhouse is still standing (after some adjustments this morning), that we have captured a lot more rainwater thanks to some work by Chris, and that the chicken mysteries continue. We got three eggs today, and one soft-shelled egg. So, I guess we'll have to do some reading to see what it means when a chicken lays a soft-shelled egg. But, it will have to wait until tomorrow as I am headed for bed post haste!

Today's photo is from the top of our hill. We had lots of crocuses this year, and this photo captures them as they look after they flower. Quite windblown I think!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
