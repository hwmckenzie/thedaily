Hi,

Lots of chicken updates tonight from the last few days.

The Chickshaw continues to come together. I took the day off today to work on it. Tomorrow we are making a trip to town for a few last supplies, and I am  hopeful it will be completed by the end of this weekend. Just in time too as the chickens are requesting new foraging pasture!

One of our chickens has gone broody and has been sitting on some eggs for at last four days now. She lays flat in the nest box and must head out to eat and drink when no one is watching. The other chickens, being chickens, are kicking shaving on to her, pecking at her, and Chris saw one eating one of the eggs under her today. Rude things! We are considering trying to move her, but it still gets cold at night so we are hesitant to put her somewhere by herself that isn't insulated. It would be quite exciting if she hatched some chicks of her own!

Our indoor chicks are doing well. They are getting a bit feisty and also working on their pecking order. They  might look cute, but they are still chickens! I think they are also molting at the moment as they are looking a bit rough, and when they run around the kennel tiny feathers and chick fluff float up. They also had some excitement yesterday as we took them on a field trip to the outdoors! They were quite hesitant at first, but soon left their kennel to explore. We even saw some scratching and pecking.

Today's photo is of the chicks on their field trip.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
