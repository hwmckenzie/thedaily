Hi,

Well, today is "Sunday" for me, so I am writing this while contemplating the fact that tomorrow is "Monday". Now that I am back working out in the world, I realize that one thing I didn't miss while working from home was packing lunches. What a time saver it is to be able to assemble your lunch directly from your fridge and pantry, right when you are ready to eat it! Not to mention the amount of tupperware you are saved from washing.

Chris and I made some good progress on outdoor projects today. After a hiatus from working on our vegetable garden beds (you'll recall these are made from some wood given to us by Marlene and will be beside our deck), we made some new progress today. We started by fixing an error we made just before we left off working on them, which was related to not checking that things were square before pounding a side into the ground with a piece of rebar. Oops! Thanks to the internet, pulling out the rebar went much more smoothly than expected. With the base of both beds level(ish) and secured to the ground, we set about adding layers. Well, I started, but then quickly handed the drill off to Chris, and he carried on while I took the mower around to try to rescue our trees from the ever encroaching grass. Hopefully we won't have to do this too many more times. In our permaculture class we learned about these hemp mats you can buy which are made in Alberta. They sit around the young trees and act as a barrier to the grass to reduce competition. By the time they decompose, the trees are big enough to have escaped the grass. Inspired by my hour spent pushing our mower around our trees, during which I had a too close encounter with our irrigation hose, I ordered a bunch of these mats this afternoon and they have already shipped! I am excited to see how they work as we certainly spend a lot of time mowing around our trees... and whoever decided where to plant them did not take into account an efficient layout for mowing. Not to mention, thanks to the dogs, our yard is akin to the surface of the moon, with craters large enough to swallow both mower and human operator!

The chickens continue to do well, and today we got five eggs for the first time in a while. They are growing quite confident, and today I watched as one of them chased a bug! While I like seeing them feel so at home, they are starting to feel just a little too at home around the front step. They really like the willows there, as well as my little garden with spruce shrubs, which is also where I plant red runner beans (with seeds all the way from my mom's garden in PEI!). Anyway, I decided today that I would fence the area off, as otherwise the beans probably won't get a chance to grow. Today's photo shows the chickens demonstrating the effectiveness of my fencing.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
