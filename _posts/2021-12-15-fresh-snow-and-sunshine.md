After a few gray days, the sun came out today. With the frost and fresh snow on the trees, it was quite pretty. Best admired from indoors though as the temperature has taken a sharp dive! We did get out for our morning walk, but it was a short one on account of Seuss who was starting to hop on three legs. I'm not sure why, but when it is cold the dogs seem to find deep fresh snow much more uncomfortable than packed snow. Seuss was the only one having trouble this morning though. Sadie says she's got enough fur between her toes to handle much colder temps and Revi just goes so fast that her paws aren't on the ground long enough to get frostbite! We braved the cold again this afternoon for another short walk. It is amazing how much more closed in the forest feels with all the frost on the trees. It looks so different in spots that even though I know where I am, it looks completely unfamiliar. 

Today's photo was taken as I headed up the hill this afternoon. The dogs had gone up ahead and Seuss came back to see what was taking me so long!
