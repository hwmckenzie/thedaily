I feel I have spent quite a bit of time indoors lately. Last week I spent two days hiking around with Seuss. So far this week we are one for three on our afternoon dog walks, and my butt is starting to look like a mirror image of my desk chair, or so I assume. Hopefully I can remedy this quickly. The dogs and I can only take so many lazy indoor days before bouncing off the walls (the dogs) or going soft (me). I am taking tomorrow and Friday off, so hopefully I will get out there and see the world... And have something better to write about here!

Today's photo is of Seuss demonstrating the best way to make sure you always know where your octopus is.

Hugs,<br />
