Hi,

Based on emails from my uncle Bob, there was about a 40 degree difference in temperature between Dartmouth NS and Innisfree AB today. So not only are we on opposite ends of the country, we are seasons apart! Even though it was quite chilly here today, the chickens still ventured out to their favourite spot under the deck. They were not impressed with the snow though and several did a combination of hopping, flying, and squawking as they navigated the drifts. I spent the day outside with them, renovating our dog run to be a covered winter chicken run. The main thing was to add a roof and then wrap the sides in poly to stop the wind. I got the roof done and half of the poly up before the sun started to go down and I fled inside to have a bath and warm my icy feet. Chris is concerned that I have a construction addiction now, or that I am a sucker for punishment. I do have a few other small projects in mind, but I am trying to keep the list from growing any more.

 The dogs (yes, we still have dogs, and they pointed out that I haven't told any stories about them lately!) and sheep are all doing well.

Today's photo is of me working on the chicken run. This was taken around lunchtime, so I'll take a photo of the finished product tomorrow. We'll have to bait it with something to entice the chickens to check it out. It will be hard to compete with their already established habit of going under the deck.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
