I realize that October is not over yet, but I thought I would wrap up my monthly posts with a few thoughts from the beginning of October.

We wrapped up our training in Hamilton on October 1 and then started our (long!) drive home. We retraced our route along the north shore of Georgian Bay, arriving in Batchawana Bay at the east end of Lake Superior in the dark. Luck was with us when we stumbled upon The Voyageur's Lodge and Cookhouse as a place to rest our heads for two nights. Our host Gail was lovely, the motel rooms were furnished with log furniture and a canoeing motif, the complimentary coffee and huge homemade apple fritters were delicious, the beach on Lake Superior was right across the road, and we could order a roast chicken dinner to be eaten outside at a table overlooking the lake. It was like waking up in a wonderful dream! Heather and I took a day off there and visited some waterfalls and a beach of smooth pebbles. The waterfalls were surrounded by maples in all their fall colors. We took so many pictures, I think the dogs were quite fed up with us by the end! The next day we did the drive from Batchawana Bay along the north short of Lake Superior to Thunder Bay. It was like driving through a Group of Seven painting. I'm quite sure we caught the leaves at the peak of their fall glory. Heather and I spent most of the drive with our eyes wide and mouths open, exclaiming around every bend in the road. The aspens of Alberta put on a good fall show, but nothing can compare to what we saw on that drive. It made me want to move there on the spot, and I did send Chris a few real estate listings!

We took one more day off back in Gimli, which gave us the chance to visit the Gimli Glider Museum. For those not familiar with the story, in 1983 an Air Canada Boeing 767 ran out of fuel on its way from Montreal to Edmonton and made an emergency landing in Gimli. With no engines operating, the crew successfully glided the plane to a landing at the former Royal Canadian Air Force base. No longer operational as an airport, at the time of the landing the runway was being used for a car race. I'm sure it was quite a shock to have a passenger plane arrive silently in the middle of the racetrack! Amazingly there were no injuries. The museum was really first class and I would highly recommend it. In addition to parts of the plane itself which were rescued after it was decommissioned (it did go on to fly many more years after the amazing landing), the museum also has a real flight simulator. I can say that, with the assistance of the museum interpretor, I successfully landed the plane! She did have to remind me not to "white-knuckle it", but overall I think it did quite well!

Two days later Seuss and I were back home and enjoying our morning dog walk through familiar fields with Chris, Sadie, and Revi.

Today's photo is of Seuss and I enjoying the waterfalls near Batchawana Bay. Those leaves have me grinning from ear to ear, even now.
