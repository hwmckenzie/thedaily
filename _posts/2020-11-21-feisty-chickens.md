Hi,

A quick one tonight as the sleep gnomes are calling me. Our patients are slowly improving, I think. One is for sure ready to rejoin the flock, and hopefully the other two won't be too far behind her. This presents the question of how to reintegrate them. When BB came into the house for one night this summer, we just put her right back in with her flock-mates the next day. Since these hens have been separated for five days already, it might not be so easy. The internet suggests you need to reintegrate them slowly, where they can spend a bit of time in a holding pen so the other hens can see them, but can't touch (i.e. peck!) them. This might in fact really be necessary. We tried a mini-merging of our patients this morning as we thought the Delaware might like to upgrade from the small dog kennel and join the two leghorns in the larger kennel. For reference, the kennels are next to each other in the basement. This did not go smoothly! As soon as we put the Delaware in, the fight was on! We're not sure who instigated it, but it was definitely not looking very friendly. There was pecking and circling and rushing at each other with wings flapping. I snatched the Delaware out of the cage and rebuffed (perhaps a little strongly!) the leghorn, and Chris and I sort of sat there in shock. I guess I'll need to fashion some sort of small pen/crate that we can set up in the coop to hold the returnees until we're sure the flock won't attack them. Stay tuned for how that goes!

Today's photo is of Sadie this morning, patiently waiting for her walk.

Hugs,<br />
