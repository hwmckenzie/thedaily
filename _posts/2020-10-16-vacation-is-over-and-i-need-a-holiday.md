Hi!

I've missed a few days of emails as I've been completely consumed with chicken coop building. Here are some of the "highlights" from the last few days...

The weather has turned quite cold and windy. The wind really is what makes it feel like winter, and makes working outside not as enjoyable as it was a week ago. The coop is coming, slowly. Since my last update, we've put all the siding on, added a ridge board for the roof, done endless angle calculations for the rafters, cut said rafters, and today I installed some of them. There is a small (ok, I admit it, miniscule) chance I could get the roof done before I go away for a few days next week for work. I am also considering trying to install the window. We stopped at Rona in Vermilion to get some supplies and advice, and the guy there reminded me "it is just a chicken coop". This has inspired me to just shove the window in my rough opening and see what happens! 

Meanwhile, we have wrapped the chicken run in plastic to break the wind, added straw to the summer coop, plugged in their heated waterer, and turned up their cosy coop heater all in an attempt to keep them comfortable. They come outside everyday and spend lots of time in the yard, so I guess they haven't frozen yet. The sheep also seem to be doing well. Their water freezes at night, but they still don't use their shed, so things must not be too dire. We have also let them out into the yard during the day for the last two days as there is still lots of grass to eat, so they are enjoying their freedom. They are very happy to follow me back into their pen for oats at the end of the day, so everyone is happy. This week we ordered some winter animal supplies, including a heating element for the sheep water, so we are anxiously checking the mail.

The dogs have also been adding some excitement around here these last few days. Yesterday Seuss and Revi took off after what we later determined were coyotes. Revi came back, but all we found of Seuss was his frisbee. Unfortunately I realized I had forgotten to turn on his Tractive, at which point I crumpled into a puddle right in the middle of the trail and cried for a few minutes before Chris helped me up and we went off to find Seuss (we did find him not too long later. Bad dog!). This is what happens after you spend two weeks working full days on building a chicken coop in the wind and the cold. You end up crumpled on the ground in the middle of the forest before 9 am! This morning we woke up to find that Revi was unable to use her back end. We took her to the vet, who suggested we take her to the city as she thought it might be something quite serious. So, off Chris went with Revi, while I stayed home to play Sisyphus... I mean, build the chicken coop. I think Chris drew the short straw as he spent the whole day waiting for Revi, and they didn't find anything. So the grand conclusion is that she needs to stay very quiet for two weeks, she has pain meds, and it might still be something bad, we'll just have to wait and see. So, overall quite unsatisfying!

Needless to say we are all in need of a restful weekend, except that we have the second part of our pumper course, which includes a test on Sunday!

Today's photo is of the current status of the chicken coop.
