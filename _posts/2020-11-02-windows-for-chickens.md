Hi!

Well, after a few days of radio silence, I'm back!

I can report that the watercraft inspection stations I supervise are now both closed, all the gear is in storage, the rental trucks are returned, and all the seasonal staff I am responsible for all have their loose ends tied up, almost. It is a wonderful time of year!!!

Work continues on the chicken coop. We are enjoying a nice reprieve from the recent cold temperatures. Today it made it up to 19Â°C! Such an enjoyable afternoon, it made me very nostalgic for summer! This was lucky as I spent a lot of it cutting out small, finicky pieces of siding to go around the large window. This is a result of installing the siding before the window. Rookie mistake! Tomorrow I am hoping a friend will come and help progress the coop faster, but our track record with people showing up to help isn't great, so I am not holding my breath.

The dogs also enjoyed some time outside this afternoon. With the arrival of the Delawares, we have been letting the chickens out of their pen everyday, to avoid any chicken in-fighting caused by overcrowded conditions. Therefore, all dog time outside must be supervised for the time being. Everyone was on their best behaviour today, and doing their best to ignore the chickens. At one point poor Revi got surrounded by a chicken posse, and looked quite concerned and I watched as she retreated to a safer location, lest she get in trouble!

Today's photo shows the results of the installation of our small window. The crazy look I have is just how I look all the time now. I hope it will pass once the chicken coop is done, though I've heard that if you make a face too long it might get stuck that way... so hopefully the chicken coop is done soon!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
