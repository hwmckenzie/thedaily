Hi,

Today was a wonderful wintery day. Fresh snow falling all day, but not too much, and also not too cold. If the sun comes out tomorrow and there is no wind I will be a happy camper. I have plans to transform the dog run into a covered run for the chickens where they can be outside but escape the snow and wind chill. I have some ideas based on photos I found on the internet (always dangerous!), but only tomorrow will tell if I am able to make them a reality.

Today's photo is of Monsieur Rooster on the threshold of his new custom built home. All the chickens came out today to enjoy some fresh air. They like the area under our deck as it faces the sun (though there was none today) and is snow free.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
