Hi,

After a few days of cloudy and cold weather, the sun came out this afternoon and it warmed up. It wasn't warm this morning though and there was quite the frost overnight, so I was glad I harvested most of the tomatoes. I was able to lure the sheep into their pen last night, but this morning I experienced a moment of unexplained insanity and decided to let them back out into the yard. I felt bad for them as they have eaten most of the grass in their current pen and I think they like roaming around throughout the day. I tell you, it was a moment of insanity! I am still struggling to come up with a round pen and chute design, using inexpensive materials and that will actually contain our jumping sheep, so that we can invite the sheepdog over. 

Things have really slowed down at work, so I have decided to take the next two days off and take advantage of the good (I hope!) fall weather and to maintain momentum on our fall projects. Oddly I feel like I am slacking off, but in reality I know things will run just fine without me at work, and better to take the time off than feel like a slacker while at work if there is nothing to do. I'm sure it will pick up again soon enough, so I should enjoy it while I can!

Today's photo is of NewB. NewB is the chicken who came with our rooster after the loss of BB. For the last few days, shortly after letting the chickens out of their coop in the morning we have found her outside the pen and have to sheperd her back in. As a side note, so far our chickens have proven to be more amenable to shepherding than our sheep... Well, this morning upon returning from the dog walk we got to witness her escape in progress. After walking around the top of the pen she hopped up onto the roof, and then proceeded to FLY about 15 feet from the top of the coop to the ground under the bird feeder! We were very impressed! I am starting to wonder if she is laying her eggs in a bush somewhere, as we have had only three eggs for the last three days... which is coincidentally how many days she has escaped the coop first thing in the morning.

Hugs,
Hannah
