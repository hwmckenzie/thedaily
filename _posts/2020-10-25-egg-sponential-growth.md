Hi,

I feel optimistic that the weather is on a warming trend. It was still chilly today, but the sun came out for the first time in a while. In fact, the snow melted off our solar panels and we generated 10.7 kilowatt hours! Chris tells me that we haven't generated this much power in a day since October 13 when we generated 12.8, which is still far less than we generated on September 30, at 19.2.

After our dog walk, during which Seuss recovered a frisbee he lost the day before, I had a quick chat with my parents and got caught up on the Island news and my Dad's birthday dinner menu (wish I was there!). Then I did some yard work before Chris and I got down to business with the chicken coop in the afternoon. I am pleased to say that the roof is almost on! Progress seems to be slow at the moment, but there are a lot of decisions to make and little construction problems to solve which all take time. Not to mention contending with cold hands and wind. Overall I have a much better sense of why it took so long to build our house, and quite a lot of sympathy for the builders considering how much of it was done in February and March!

Today's photo is of our egg production for the day. The new chickens are settling in quite well and laid four eggs! We also let them out of the dog run late in the afternoon and they had a bit of time to mingle with the leghorns. Overall each group seemed to keep to themselves, except at one point one of the leghorns got stuck in the dog run with the Delawares. Fences do seem to pose a challenge for chickens! Hopefully they enjoy the next few days of warmer temperatures, and can all move into the same coop together soon. Warmth in numbers!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
