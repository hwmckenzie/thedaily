I seem to be short of things to report about our property and animals these days. I suppose this is a good thing, as it must mean that things are going smoothly? Maybe it means we need a new challenge? Hmmmm, while I mull that over, I hope you enjoy the photo!

Today's photo is of the chickens taking some air in their solarium. They quite like the solarium as it is snow-free. The chickens do not like walking in snow at all. This was a special day as we hung up a 50% off lettuce for them to enjoy. Chief was very thoughtful as he would tear off pieces and then put them on the ground for his hens. He often does that when I feed them grapes as well. He'll take them from me, but almost always puts them down for the hens... who fight over them of course!

Hugs,<br />
