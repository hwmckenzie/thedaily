Hi,

Well, my friend did show up to work on the coop, and he brought his brother. But unfortunately they still got less done than we, and I think they, wished. Maybe this project is cursed? I guess that's just how it goes when the original builder is new and the wood she used is old! In any case, I am making a run to town tomorrow for the supplies we need to finish the essentials and then I'll take another day off. Good thing I have lots of them and can get any essential work done quickly first thing in the morning. We still hope the chickens will be able to move in soon.

Speaking of the chickens, they are having a ball! Today was another nice day and they were all over the yard and nearby bushes enjoying the great fall weather. Watching them dust bath in their favorite spot and then sleep in the sun is pretty darn cute. The rooster had his work cut out for him keeping track of all his ladies. Chris suggested we get him a lifeguard chair so he has a better view. I am glad he takes his job seriously, as danger is lurking nearby. We spotted a coyote and Chris and I prowled around until we thought it had moved on, but I'm sure it will be back. It would be nice to leave the dogs out with the chickens to guard them, but I don't trust them just yet. 

Today's photo is of the chickens enjoying their day. If only life was so simple for all of us. Although even chickens have things to worry about. Such as coyotes. And also having to lay an egg every day. Listening to some of them while they do it leads one to think that it is not very pleasant!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
