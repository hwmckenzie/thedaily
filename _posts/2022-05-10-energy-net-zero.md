This morning we crossed over from being energy consumers to energy producers for 2022! While we were going about our business, our solar panels were quietly going about their business. Being bombarded by photons, which knocked electrons loose, which generated an electric field, which created an electric current, which was enough to exceed the power needed by our house, thus pushing power to the grid! 

Sadie also had a big moment today as she went to the vet to get her stitches out. She is healing well and only has two spots we need to keep an eye on. She also did a little dance this morning while we were getting ready to go for the walk, so I think she is feeling more like herself.

Today's photo is of the technology of the hour, which Chris tells me is generating 103W as I type this, even though it is almost 9 pm!
