Hi,

We spent today away from home completing the last day of our fire training course. Tomorrow is the test. Yikes! It was very cold here today and we succeeded in making some ice while practicing all our pumping skills. So far the chickens and sheep seem to be doing ok with the arrival of winter, but I feel bad for them as I find it very cold myself. We let everyone have free run of the yard while we were gone today, so the dogs probably had some good sheep and chicken TV to watch from their indoor vantage point. Revi seems to be doing better, but she is still limping on the front end and so we continue to worry about her. It is hard to believe that on Monday I will be heading to the field with Seuss for a final (hopefully!) boar scat deployment. The inspection station I supervise in Vermilion closes on October 31st. By then I am hoping all our animals will be settled for winter and then things can quiet down a bit.

Today's photo is from some recent care we gave to one of our chickens. This poor girl had a poop stuck to her feathers and it just wasn't falling off, so we finally caught her and brought her inside for some tidying up. The dogs were quite interested, but she seemed relaxed by the time we were done, though quite happy to rejoin her friends outside. I think I had her in a bit of a death grip as I had visions of her escaping and flapping all over our kitchen with the dogs and Chris and I in hot pursuit!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
