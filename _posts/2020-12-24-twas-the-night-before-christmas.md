... when all through the cabin, 
Nothing was stirring, not even a hen.
The Zoom calls were done, computers put away with care,
In hopes that tomorrow's Zoom calls would make us feel like we were there.
The dogs were nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of winter walks and rabbits danced in their heads.
And Chris doing dishes, and I going clickity clack,
Had just settled down to write this email before taking my nightly nap!

We had a really nice Christmas Eve day here with some sunshine and warm weather. The chickens have really been enjoying the recent warmer weather and have been spending a lot of time outside most days. Hopefully this will help carry them through the cold spells which I'm sure we'll have before spring arrives. 

I have started to think of the chickens as a cluster of meteors orbiting the house. When we let them out in the morning, it isn't long until they have escaped their pen by squeezing through the bottom fence square and going under the kitchen window on the west side of the house on their way to the morning buffet under the bird feeder. They spend a while there, and then enjoy some time under our front steps and in the willow bushes beside the door. Apparently willow leaves are very tasty! Then they cluster near the gate, which is a bit of a bottleneck as the fence squares in this part of the fence are smaller and not as easy to squeeze through. Usually Chris or I go out and open the gate for them so they can get back into the yard. Before heading back to their coop they usually spend some time under the deck on the east side of the house. They also like to hang out on the deck, parading back and forth in front of our patio door. They peer in to see what we're up to and if we're going to bring them any treats. I think they might also be wondering why they don't get to live in the house with us and the dogs. Later in the afternoon they are usually back in their pen, but depending on the weather they might make two or more circuits of the house in a day. The chickens really are quite entertaining. The dogs are not enamoured with the chickens' orbits as it means they have to be supervised in the yard (=less yard time) and they get teased by the chickens peering in the door, but get in trouble when they bark at them. What is a dog to do?

Today's photo is of the chickens massing at the gate, ready to be let back into the yard for their return trip to the coop.

Hugs,
Hannah
