Today was a momentous day for two reasons. First, I have now been doing yoga virtually with the [Shala Ashtanga Yoga Centre](https://www.theshala-eayc.com/ "Shala Ashtanga Yoga Centre") in Edmonton for one whole year, or 214 classes! I was very lucky to find this studio and the wonderful teachers. I am sure my yoga practice has helped me weather the ups and downs of the last year, and I look forward to continuing with my practice to see where it takes me (and my back!) in the upcoming year.

Second, Book 9 of the Outlander series by Diana Gabaldon was released today! I am a very big Outlander fan and I think Diana's writing is very entertaining and witty, not to mention she tells a wonderful and unique story. Seuss and I have listened to all her books (several times through!) while driving around Alberta, out to Manitoba and Ontario, and down south to California and Texas. I can't recommend it enough and am really looking forward to listening to this book. I think the conjunction of these two events must be auspicious.

Today's photo is of all the dogs and the frisbee, present and accounted for, enjoying their evening walk. Sadly for Revi she will be relegated to on-leash walks for the next day or so as she has a limp in one of her back legs that we are hoping will go away with a bit of rest. No doubt this will come as a great disappointment to Revi. Into each life some rain must fall I guess!

Hugs,<br />
