Revi is a dog of many nicknames. Rev-a-loo, Revioli, Reverie, Rotten Revi, Rev-a, and the most fitting of late, Revi Rover. 

Revi started leaving the yard to go on solo adventures over the summer. It started with her going to visit Chris in his office by squeezing between the house and fence. We closed off that escape route with a large log. Not to be deterred, Revi found an alternate route, which remained her secret for a while. However, a few weeks ago she divulged it by accident as she was observed making her escape. It turns out she had been jumping the fence where a moose had partially squished it in the spring. Since she never really seemed to get into any trouble when she was out, and she was pretty good about coming back when we called, we just let things go on like this for a while. 

We were also able to use her Tractive to see where she was. This was a partially false sense of security though as it required us to remember to turn it on and keep it charged, otherwise Revi was able to go into stealth mode. For a few days she consistently visited a stand of trees near the end of our driveway. Interested to know why she always went there, Chris and I stopped to check it out with all the dogs on one of our walks. We never did figure out what all the fuss was about, but whatever it was we ruined the magic with our presence as Revi stopped visiting the spot after that. Eventually we decided it would be better if everyone stayed in the yard, so Chris did a temporary fix on the fence by pulling it up again. This solved the problem for a while, but Miss Revi seems to have found another way out. Last night, after the yard was suspiciously quiet for a while, we discovered Revi on the front steps, a large bone in her possession. Where on earth did she get that? Tonight at 7:15 pm the camera by our house captured Revi heading into the conservation area for a quick jolly. So, we are back to the escape route identification drawing board.

Today's photo is of the rover herself, daydreaming about her next unsupervised adventure.
