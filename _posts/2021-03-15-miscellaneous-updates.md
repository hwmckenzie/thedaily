Hi,

I thought tonight I would share some minutia which I keep forgetting to include in my daily posts. 

Yesterday my lunchtime yoga was interrupted by a chicken in distress. It seems like many of the chickens are quite noisy, and they often have Chris and I running out to see what is wrong, when in fact nothing is wrong at all. Not so this time. I have to say, there is a big difference between a slightly distressed chicken and a chicken in dire distress. Chris, not having to unwind himself from a yoga pose before responding, got outside first to find a hawk with a good hold on one of our hens. He yelled at it and clapped his hands, at which point it tried to take off with the hen. Unable to lift off the ground with its chicken cargo, it abandoned the hen and flew away. To our surprise, the hen appeared to be fine and has been acting like a normal chicken ever since. Where was our rooster you ask? Chris said he saw him run under the deck. I guess I can't claim I would act any differently if attacked unexpectedly from the sky.

Speaking of our rooster. Chris has had to have a few more forced cuddling sessions with him in an effort to convey to him who is the boss. We have decided to call him Stu, or Stew, depending on his attitude at the time!

You may have noticed in the recent photo of Revi in our living room chair that the curtains were a bit askew. This is due to some of the plastic rings that are used to raise and lower them breaking after so much exposure to the sun. I can report that they have be replaced and our curtains are back in working order and hanging straight. Not so for the light in our hallway. Last week Chris was changing the bulb when the stem holding it to the ceiling broke and Chris was left holding the light fixture!

We also have some updates on our incubating eggs. Yesterday we candled them again to assess progress after two weeks. Sadly it looks like about five eggs are what we have come to learn are called "quitters". These are chicks that start to develop, but then die for some reason. We left them in for now just in case, but we will need to take out any out that aren't developing before the final "lockdown" when it is time for the hatch, as otherwise apparently they may explode and contaminate the other eggs. However, it seems opinions vary on how likely explosion is. Suggestions to assess explosive potential include smelling the eggs. We haven't tried this yet! Hopefully the remaining eggs will make it all the way to hatching, which are called "winners".

Today's photo is of Revi demonstrating why it is healthy not to take things too seriously.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
