Hi,

Day two for Chris and I attending our pumper operator course. Today we learned how to pump water from a truck and a hydrant, and how to calculate how much pressure is needed depending on how many hoses are connected, what sort of nozzle is being used, and if the engine is uphill or downhill from the person spraying water. Being in class all day, even with half of the day being hands on, is tiring! I am out of practice! 

Unfortunately this meant we were away from our property all day. Based on last night's email you know we went to bed with the sheep in their pen. Well, we also woke up with them in their pen... but sadly we did not come home to them in their pen tonight. I was able to lure them back in pretty easily with oats, but lo and behold about 30 minutes later they were out again! We walked along the fence and couldn't see any obvious breaches, so maybe tomorrow I'll get them in there and then set up a lawn chair somewhere out of sight to see if I can catch them in the act of escaping. I can't say they are endearing themselves to me with this behaviour! Perhaps no one has explained to them that for my sanity I am considering several options for the sheep, which in addition to "the sheep stay in their pen", also includes options such as "we sell the sheep" and "we send the sheep to the butcher".

Today's photo is of our training course. I am the one in blue at the center trying to figure out how to run the pumper truck.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
