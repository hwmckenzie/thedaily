Happy Gingerbread House Day! To celebrate, Chris and I decorated some gingerbread constructions we made with his Dad and sisters on Zoom. Well, we actually used a web application called Jitsi, but I just naturally found myself using "zoom" the way we use "kleenex". What does that say about the last two years?! It was fun, but now we are recovering from sugar overload.

After a rather domestic last few weeks of indoor crafts, baking, and cooking, yesterday I finally did some farm chores! Chris and I did a big clean of the chicken coop, including changing their shavings. I also made some modifications to the nighttime poop collection setup. If you recall, we had the "poop hammock". While it was working well, there was a bit of room for design improvement and it was also getting quite stained with poop. While Chris assured me we could clean it, I wasn't able to resist the opportunity for a small renovation! My new design involves a more traditional poop board under the roost, on top of which we lay newspaper. Each day the newspaper just gets folded up and put in the compost, and fresh newspaper is put down. No need for any poop scraping, which is the icky part. However, the feedback after day one from the resident chicken coop cleaner was not glowing. The chickens torn up some of the paper, and the poop soaked through, making the paper rip when it was folded up. Hmmmm. We are trying it for another day, but I foresee a return to the hammock in our future!

Today's photo is of the chickens checking out their newly refreshed coop.
