Hi,

A big thunderstorm here tonight, so I am sitting in our reading corner, enjoying a nice cool cross-breeze while I write today's email. I am very glad we had the storm as it got up to 29Â°C today, so without it, no one would have slept well at all.

We received our hemp mats in the mail that I wrote about a while ago. These are squares (18"x18") with a slit in them, which we are putting around our small trees in "the shield". The idea is that they prevent the grass from growing up around the tree and competing with it for water, space and light. This afternoon we weed-wacked the grass around all the small trees, laid down the mats, and then watered on top of them to help plaster them to the ground. Following tonight's storm, they are certainly well-watered now! And, upon quick inspection, I don't think any blew away. So, fingers crossed they work as expected and we now have one less chore to do of mowing the grass around the trees. And I can report that we cooked frozen pizza on the BBQ and watched a movie, so we did get some relaxing in!

Today's photo is of Revi and Sadie, hanging out. I guess sometimes life is just better when you are upside down!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
