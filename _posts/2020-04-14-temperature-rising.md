Hello!

Here is the news from today.

Lately we have been taking advantage of the thick snow crust created by the daily melting and nightly freezing cycle. The crust is currently strong enough to support not only the dogs, but us (mostly!), so we have access to a whole new area for our walks. After a winter of being confined to our carefully maintained snowshoe trails, this is a real taste of freedom! We stride out across the fields, covering ground with ease.... until we hit a weak spot and unexpectedly plunge through up to our knees! Then we flail like fish out of water until we can make our way back to a spot that will hold our weight. Meanwhile the dogs prance around us with their lighter bodies helpfully distributed on four paws, no doubt wondering what on earth our problem is! This morning we went to a far away spot to try to place a camera where Chris saw bears last year. We weren't able to pick a suitable spot there, but did find a tree for it on the way back. We also saw a trail of blood drops and wondered what animal was leaving it. We briefly considered following it to see what story it would tell, but school and work called, so we turned towards home.

By lunchtime it was warm, solidly on the side of positive temperatures. The birds were abundant and Chris even spotted a fox checking out our compost. This evening he also spotted a Northern Shrike, likely on its way north for the summer. This was our first shrike spotting, and although very cool, hopefully it does not become a regular visitor or I fear for our chickadees and other resident songbirds.

We also watched the free live webinar I mentioned yesterday about permaculture and really enjoyed it. So, we are feeling excited about what might happen at our property this summer, but also hesitant about whether or not we can actually accomplish something. Chris picked up a guide to chickens from UFA today. If we order them, the lady says they will be here in two weeks. Yikes!

Today's photo is of Seuss gazing at the thing he loves most in the whole world. We were hanging out on the top of our hill as Chris was trying to take a photosphere, but unfortunately his phone died, so we will have to try again tomorrow.

Hugs,
Hannah
