Hi,

There was a first in our house today. We have chickens in our basement, and they aren't in the freezer! Three to be exact. With the dust settling on the coop construction, we've had more time to look at our birds, and some are looking pretty rough. We've got a few with frostbitten combs thanks to some poor choices on their part to stay outside in the wind, and some very unseasonably high humidity levels. Some have bare, pasty, unhappy vents. And they all have mites, or lice, or both, likely thanks to all the time they spent hanging out with wild birds at the bird feeder. For two people who care a lot about animals, we have some things to learn about how to keep our chickens in tip top health.

Tonight was the first step in our plan to get our flock healthy before winter really sets in. We brought in the three roughest birds, bathed their butts, sprayed the areas with an iodine antiseptic spray which is supposed to promote healing, rubbed "udder budder" on their combs, and then fumigated them with Doktor Doom Lice Killer for Poultry Plus+. I dare any parasites to stand up to that double plus! Once they had received this treatment we put them in the "sick bay", which consists of some dog crates in our basement. The dogs offered to act as nurses, but we told them no. Now they hover at the basement trap door in the hopes of getting a glimpse, or a whiff, of the patients. Hopefully after a few days in the sick bay and repeated treatments, their butts and combs will be in better shape and they can return to the coop. The temperatures are still only a little below 0Â°C this week, so fingers crossed that a few days inside won't set them back too much in their adjustment to winter temperatures. Tomorrow we will enact step two, which involves cleaning out all the bedding from the coop, and fumigating the interior and all remaining birds inside it.

When I bought the things for the chickens at UFA today I stopped by the liquor store. Something tells me we will need a little something to fortify us over the next few days!

Chris also asked me tonight if I could confidently say we will never have a sheep in our house. I told him I could not. I expect that if we do have any lambs arrive, and any of them are cold or not cared for by their moms they will end up in our bathroom. Never a dull moment here!

Today's photo is of one of our chickens going through her treatment. They all bore it quite well and there was only a bit of flapping and squawking. 

Hugs,<br />
