Hi,

The great gray owl visited us again today, much to the chickens' dismay. Just after Chris left for his office there was a great outcry from outside. I rushed outside, but Chris said it was just a hen who had a panic attack when he came out the door. Well, a few minutes later there was a second outcry, this one louder and continuous. Out I rushed in my slippers to confront the danger. After looking around in the tree tops without spotting anything, I happened to look at our fence. There was the owl. It was sitting on one of the fence posts staring at me, unblinking. It was so majestic! Much closer than any other time I have seen it. I watched it for a few minutes, while the rooster reminded me that this was a very unwelcome guest in his opinion. Then it swiveled its head to give me one last stare, launched effortlessly into the air, flew silently across the open area and disappeared into the trees. Amazing!

The rest of the morning involved several more chicken responses, though I never saw the owl again, or any other predator. I think after their fright first thing in the morning all the chickens were on high alert and giving quite a few false alarms. I did a bit of reading about chicken alarm calls tonight and it turns out that they make two different sounds depending on whether the danger is on the ground or in the air. The alarm call for ground-based danger is continuous clucking that increases in volume and speed, while the warning for aerial danger is described as more of a scream or shriek. It definitely translates as "take cover!!!", even to this non-chicken speaker!

I spent quite a bit of time today working on my next permaculture post. If you would like to read it, you can find it on the [Property Report](https://propertyreport.upnix.com/).

And just as I finished writing this post I received a text from Alberta Health Services letting me know that I don't have covid. Hooray!

Today's photo is of some common bearberry, or kinnikinnick, along one of our walking trails which is already starting to turn green.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
