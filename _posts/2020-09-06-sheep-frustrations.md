Hi,

First off, we weren't successful at recapturing Spray Paint, so she has missed her dose of antibiotic and pain medication for today. I went down to the sheep with a selection of tasty treats including sheep pellets, oats, watermelon, carrots, and apples. They were only interested in the oats, and only when I kept my distance. After I tried the "let's be friends" approach, Chris and I tried to corner them, without any luck at all. Our pen area has too many options and they are too agile and fast. I feel so frustrated and also awful that Spray Paint got bitten and now we aren't caring for her properly. But also annoyed at the sheep. What sort of evolutionary trait is running from people who are trying to help you?

In contrast, the chickens are so easy! After I harvested the veggies in the dog run garden we took them on a field trip to dig up the garden boxes. They followed Chris right over without any fuss and spent what I assumed was an enjoyable few hours in the garden. Then when it was time we opened the gate and they ran back to their pen.

Today's photo is of the harvest from the dog run garden. Although we got one cabbage, I think it is full of worms. Which will be fun for the chickens I suppose. And our small cauliflower and single broccoli stalk also seem to have some sort of bug on them. I think our onions only increased slightly in size from what I planted, but our potatoes did well, and our zucchini as well. We have already eaten several zuchining, but this was the largest.

Hugs,
Hannah
