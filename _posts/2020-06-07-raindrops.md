Hello!

We are in the midst of series of rainy days. In fact our day started very early this morning, at about 2am! Chris has been putting a lot of effort in to capturing as much rainwater as possible with our various storage tanks. This takes a bit of work to move it all around and avoid overflowing any of our barrels. One day we hope to have it all connected with water flowing through the whole system by gravity... but for now it flows with the assistance of Chris! Anyway, as we fell asleep last night, Chris asked me to wake him up in the night if it was raining so he could go out and turn on our pump. This is how we found ourselves standing outside in the rain in our pajamas at 2am! When I got home from work today, he reported that we have yet to overflow our system, which is good as I believe more rain is expected tomorrow.

Today's photo is of Seuss checking out the chicken in the bathroom. He is pretty cool about it, but I don't let him hang out in there too long least he get over excited and startle the chicken. She is supposed to be convalescing after all!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
