Hi,

Quite a bit less to report on today as I was at work away from home most of the day. It has certainly been a while since "work" didn't mean sitting at my home office Ikea desk at my laptop. Although it is nice to be out of the house, the weather was quite atrocious! Windy and cold, more like early April than early June. I am definitely looking forward to warmer weather!

The chicken health saga continues. Our first patient remains reunited with the flock, but has not yet laid an egg. However, as far as I can tell, no soft eggs either. Bare Butt remains in isolation in a crate in our bathroom. Seuss has clued in that we have a chicken in the bathroom, which he finds both intriguing and vexing as he often prefers to sleep in that room, but now can't as we have the door closed. Tonight the patient enjoyed some watermelon. Before bed we are going to examine her again and maybe do another session of crop massage. Fingers crossed she doesn't lay any more soft eggs!

Today's photo is of the "swale" I dug behind our deck willows. You can see the trench a dark shadow along the deck with the weeping tile running in at the far end. The photo is actually from yesterday, but I am feeling the effects of trench digging today!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
