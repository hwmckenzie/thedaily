Happy Easter Sunday!

Today was a busy one at our cabin. Despite the shining sun and temperatures only slightly below zero, the wind was quite cutting and put a bit of damper on spending too much time outside. But, we took the dogs for a walk as usual. They don't make any weather exceptions! I made cinnamon buns before we left, so got to enjoy one with coffee upon our return while catching up with Melinda over Facetime. Unfortunately there is no way to send cinnamon buns over the internet... yet. Seuss and I also muddled our way through some training. We are trying to learn something new and even though so far it feels like the blind leading the blind, I think we may have made some progress by the end of the afternoon. At least we weren't barking at each other! Chris and I also organized an Easter egg hunt for the dogs. Each dog got to hunt for 10 pieces of hot dog we hid around the house, while the other dogs formed the peanut gallery out on the deck. Today's photo (series) is of Tammi and Chris hunting for hotdogs.

Still one more day to go in this weekend!
