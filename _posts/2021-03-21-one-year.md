Hi,

Hard to believe, but this day last year was my first daily post. So many abnormal things have happened over the last year, while at the same time so many normal things haven't. I live half on the internet and half in the physical world. As far as the dogs are concerned all is right with the world because their humans are home all the time now!

Today we put the finishing touches on the brooder in anticipation of the chicks' arrival. No apparent changes to the eggs yet, but we've heard a few chirps, so they must be getting ready! Chris has set up a live stream, which you can check out [here]("http://thepropertychicks.ca"). Note that this is the real deal, so the circle of life applies. I expect the next few days might have a sad moment or two for us.

For today's photo I had planned to take the same shot as I did on March 21, 2020. We are so much further ahead into spring when compared to last year! But unfortunately I forgot until after it was dark. So, today's photo is of our dugout. I took it yesterday and I bet there has been even more melting by now. Hopefully tomorrow's photo will be of some cute fluffy chicks!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
