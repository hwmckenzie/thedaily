I believe that spring has truly arrived at the property for 2022. We have seen a few robins. In addition to the crocuses, the mysterious tiny bulbs out our kitchen window have flowered. The grass is growing, and today it rained. The goal for this weekend is to complete the summer coop renovations. Last night Chris helped me settle the new base into place (and it fit!), and as I sit here on my couch with all the many weekend hours ahead of me, the time line to finish by Sunday night seems possible. Time will tell!

Sadie is healing well. She removed some of her drains herself and I removed the last ones tonight. I think tomorrow I will give her another bath just to keep everything nice and clean. Hopefully her stitches will come out when she sees the vet on Tuesday.

The baby chicks continue to grown. We have installed a swing in their crate and they didn't hesitate to test it out. So far it seems that only one chick can be on the swing at a time, but they are getting more balanced all the time, so perhaps two will stick the landing by tomorrow. We had a bit of a social hour with them last night while their nurse (Seuss) was distracted outside. So far they seem much friendlier than last year's flock. A few were even willing to fly up and land on my legs.

Today's photo is of one of the crocuses along our walk after the rain.

Hugs,<br />
