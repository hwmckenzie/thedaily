Today was one of those days were nothing terrible happened... but overall it didn't really feel like a success. I suspect this is related to the adjustment to being "back at the desk" so to say after a very "in the field" type of summer. I think Seuss and I are both working through a bit of cabin fever. Seuss chooses to express his antsy-ness by stealing kibble when he thinks no one is watching, rushing in and out of the door just because it is being opened, and barking at airplanes flying over our house. While I do less barking, I have eaten (more) than my fair share of Girl Guide cookies, which I try to do when no one is looking! Sadie is also suffering from my increased presence at home, as I am newly motivated to improve her oral hygiene. She is now subject to two brushings a day, a habit I plan to keep up until there is an improvement in her breath! Sadie points out that this is one brushing more than she sees me do. Hmmm.... The chickens also only gave us one egg today. 

Today's photo is from our evening dog walk. We headed over to the conservation area on the road and decided to venture in and walk home along what I call the "Home trail". We've been avoiding the conservation area since Nov 1 as it is hunting season, but I figured it was unlikely to see any hunters there tonight so close to sunset and without any trucks parked at the gate. It was a nice treat to walk that way, and we got home just before it got to be truly dusk (despite the darker evenings thanks to the time change). Here is Revi patiently waiting for me to make sure there aren't any cars coming before heading across the road.

Hugs,<br />
