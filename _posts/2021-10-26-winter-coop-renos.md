I am going to keep with the chicken theme tonight. 

Things seem to be going well with phase one of our flock relationship therapy. After a good night's rest in the house last night, the leghorn rejoined the flock (minus the bully) today, and successfully went to bed with them in the coop all by herself tonight. Very promising! We'll let that settle for a few days, and then move on the phase two, the reintroduction of the bully. Said chicken is still in isolation in the Chick-frame. Although she has the necessities of life, she is not happy with her situation, which she communicates to us by making the most awful noises!

As mentioned, Chris and I have also been making some improvements to the winter coop. Hopefully these will be completed soon, or at least before any really cold weather arrives. In addition to my solarium, we painted the inside white to make it brighter, Chris improved the insulation in various spots and also installed a fancy custom ventilation system, including an air filter! We also made a roost that is elevated (to increase the floor space for daytime activities), got a bigger dust bath tub, and added proper nest boxes. We never did get the nest boxes right last winter and it led to some broken eggs and an outbreak of egg eating. There are a few finishing touches remaining, including re-installing the linoleum flooring, but I think we might be getting close (she says optimistically!)

Today's photo is of the current state of the winter coop. Very much a work in progress!
