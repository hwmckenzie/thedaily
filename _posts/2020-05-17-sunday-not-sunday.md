Hi there!

Everyone at the property enjoyed day two of the long weekend, and we are all very happy about the existence of day three! Very warm here today (22°C right now), but a bit overcast. No rain though. I suppose this is a good thing because it means we can work outside, but it would be nice to have some rain soon for all the plants and trees that are well on their way already.

After the walk today, and following a bit of sitting on the couch, we moved outside. Chris did some maintenance of our various compost bins. We have three models: black bins purchased from the store, a big "compost pen" we made late last fall, and two compost barrels. Based on Chris's compost thermometer, the compost pen gets the hottest (55°C!) and the barrels (which we had high hopes for) are the coolest (they don't even register on the thermometer). The barrels are also difficult to get compost out of and may need a bit of a redesign. Initial observations suggest these temperature differences might be related to differences in volume, but they may also be caused by variation in mixing. More observation is needed. After lunch we progressed to leveling the greenhouse and installing the garden beds. All went quite smoothly, but was hot sweaty work. Tomorrow's task is to figure out what to fill the beds with. They are just over 9" tall, and I am leaning towards a method called "lasagna gardening". Apparently in addition to being a tasty pasta dish, it is a "lazy" gardening method, which sounds good to me! In this method, you first lay down cardboard or newspaper, and then layer on top of that alternating layers of browns (e.g. straw) and greens (e.g. grass clippings), finishing with a few inches of dirt. Hopefully this will work as we don't have much dirt to spare. There is a hill created when Chris's office was delivered that I am hoping contains sufficient dirt to get our greenhouse boxes up and running. Given that plan, I expect tomorrow will involve some sweating as well!

The other thing I have planned for tomorrow is making sourdough cinnamon buns. This is the last recipe in my sourdough bootcamp, and they take 36 hours to make! I started them this morning, so by tomorrow night they should be done. Maybe I'll be more motivated to savour each bite given how long I had to wait for them to finish!

Today's photo is of a bee hard at work pollinating the new flowers on our haskap bushes. There are tons of flowers this year, so I am hoping that is a sign that we will have a big crop of berries as well. I expect the birds share this wish too!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
