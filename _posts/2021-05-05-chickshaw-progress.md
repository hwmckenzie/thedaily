Hi,

Chickshaw construction continued this evening. The siding is now complete! I also cut out the entry way to the nest boxes, which are made from milk crates, as well as installing them into the shaw. This last step required a bit of sanding and chiseling to "help" them fit. Hopefully I will have more to report tomorrow.

Today's photo is of the teenage chicks. They are really settling in to their outdoor life.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
