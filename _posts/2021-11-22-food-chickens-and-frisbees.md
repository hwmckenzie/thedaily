I haven't written my blog in three days, so today I give you three short little stories relating to food, chickens, and frisbees.

Food. On Friday we received in the mail one official screech cake. Maritimers may know what I'm talking about, but for everyone else, this is a very dense and rich rum cake, to be served with rum sauce. Emphasis on the butter, sugar and rum! We proceeded with caution following the advice of the sender, Chris's dad Sandy who has recently taken up residence in Newfoundland. The caution was warranted! Chris was lukewarm on the cake, but I found it quite tasty (though I could feel my arteries clogging just looking at the thing!). However, I awoke the next morning with what I am quite sure was a hangover. What I can't know for sure is whether it was a result of the amount of butter or the amount of rum in the cake! Needless to say, I clearly have some more training to do before I can run with the Islanders! In writing this little story I did a bit of reading about Newfoundland sayings, and while I didn't use any here some of you may get some entertainment out of reading through this [link](https://www.suitcaseandheels.com/guide-to-newfoundland-slang/ "post"). I did recognize in there "chummy", a term I'm pretty sure I've hear my uncle John say which you'd use when you don't know the name of something, similar to "doodad" or "thingamajig", though he is from Lunenburg, NS and not Newfoundland.

Chickens. Well, our house chicken in particular. She seems to be on the road to recovery, so we sent her back to the coop today. Her initial welcome wasn't very friendly, but they seemed to sort things out quickly and with only a small amount of pecking, comb pulling, and body checking. Hopefully she does not relapse. In an effort to ensure her crop is not dominated by yeast, over the last few days we have been dosing her with a bit of the antifungagl medication miconazole... extracted from medication intended to treat vaginal yeast infections in humans. You have to get creative when most vets won't treat chickens!

Frisbees. Our first snow arrived last week and the dogs are being a bit naughty on our walks as the world is now suddenly much more exciting. Revi is running away more; Sadie is lagging behind more, which is just her version of running away, but she can do it more slowly by being sneaky; and Seuss is losing his frisbee more as he has to drop it to go check out all the new exciting tracks and smells. Last week he lost his "ocean bound frisbee" (which was made with recycled plastic, presumably destined for the ocean), this weekend he lost a blue frisbee which was on its last legs, and this morning he lost a green frisbee which was only one walk old. Luckily we went back tonight to the scene of the crime and he was able to find it, but not until after I had ordered three more online this morning! Smart guy!

Today's photo is of the chickens huddled on a snow-free patch of our deck. It was pretty mild today, so we decided to let them out of the coop/solarium for a bit of a change of scenery before the winter lockdown really arrives. They were quite excited, but they sure don't like walking on snow. After watching them fuss for a bit this afternoon, I went out and shoveled a path for them across the deck so they could get within flying distance of the solarium door. As soon as I shoveled the path, they lined right up to walk down it, funny birds!
