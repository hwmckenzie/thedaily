We enjoyed a very snowy day here. Very pretty, but quite wintery. Good thing we didn't have to venture out further than our dog walks. I took advantage of the continuing cold temperatures to put all our frozen food outside and defrost the freezer in the basement. Nothing like doing something exciting on your last day off before returning to work! 

I also attempted to order some yogurt starter. The trick to making yogurt is that you need some starter to inoculate your milk with that has the right mix of bacteria. So far we have been using yogurt from the grocery store, but it isn't really meant to last through multiple generations, and so the bacteria get sort of weaker over time. Plus, the whole point of making yogurt is that you don't have to buy yogurt! One thing we really like is that it cuts down a lot on the number of plastic containers that come into our house. Anyway, I found a great place to order from online, but things came to a halt when I was confronted with 33 different kinds of yogurt starter! How can a person possibly choose? 

I've started reading a new book called Gaia's Garden, which is about growing a permaculture garden. I'm not sure what it is about the coldest, darkest, and snowiest time of year that inspires the desire to create a (large, complex, expensive, and time-consuming) garden, but there it is. So far all I have committed to is reading the book. How much trouble could I possibly get into by reading a book?!

Today's photo is from our afternoon dog walk. It was very snowy and quiet. I've noticed that when I take the dogs in the afternoon by myself, they stick much closer and usually wait for me without being asked to. Maybe they feel like they need to keep an eye on my when Chris is not with me?
