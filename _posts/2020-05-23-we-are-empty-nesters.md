Hello!

Today was a big day for our vegetable seedlings, as they moved out of our house and into their summer home! We spent the day working to make sure the greenhouse was all ready for them. We got the last bed filled with dirt (no additional salamanders were harmed!), the plastic hung (with only one video call to Marlene for guidance), the plants planted, and the drip irrigation installed. No need for assistance with this last step as Chris is our in-house irrigation expert. He did struggle a bit with setting it all up given the large (excessive?) amount of mulch I had added on top of the box for weed defence. We eventually ended up pulling a lot of it off during setup and then replacing it. By the time we were done Chris, me, and the plants were all dropping from the heat. Amazing how quickly it heats up in there once the plastic is on. We left the door open until it started to cool down tonight, so hopefully by tomorrow morning all the plants will be standing upright again. Chris and I rejuvenated ourselves with a cold beverage!

With the greenhouse now in operation, tomorrow we are turning our attention to the vegetable garden boxes we are making out of wood from Marlene. We have a plan. We have (most) of the materials. Hopefully we also have the skills and the energy required for the task! So stay tuned about that.

Today's photo is of the completed greenhouse. If the weather is good tomorrow, and my cameraman is available, I am hoping to send a video tour of the greenhouse and its features as part of tomorrow's email.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
