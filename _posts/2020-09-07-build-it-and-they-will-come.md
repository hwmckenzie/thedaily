Hello!

A quick email tonight as I am quite tired and ready for bed. Part of the reason I am tired is that we had a busy day at work, though I am quite excited to say it was the last day of operation for the Cold Lake station! But, the main reason I am tired is that the sheep came by the house this morning at 3am and again at 6am. I was notified of their arrival by the dogs. Since I am a little sheep-crazed at the moment, both times I lept out of bed and went outside in my pyjamas and rubber boots to walk around the yard shaking my oat bucket and singing to the sheep in an effort to get them into the partly finished sheep shed, so we could continue Spray Paint's medication. Good thing we don't have close neighbors! I'm sure no one will be surprised to hear that it didn't work! So, as Seuss and I were off this morning, first to Cold Lake and then to Whitecourt to be in a video about wild boar, Chris is now head sheep whisperer, or more correctly, singer. I expect Spray Paint will either get better without her medication, or she will get sicker, and therefore be easier to catch, and then we can continue her treatment. I am trying to be zen about it... trying.

Today's photo is of the current progress on the sheep shed with supervisor Sadie looking on. Tonight Chris finished the siding on the walls, so when I get back we'll figure out the roof, mount the wheels and stain it. I think it is looking good! Maybe the sheep will want to test it out tonight.

Hugs,
Hannah
