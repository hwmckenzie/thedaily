The warm pacific air is slowly arriving. So slowly! I really shouldn't complain as it is currently a warm -7Â°C. But the forecast keeps promising positive temperatures, so now that's what I have my heart set on! I have all sorts of plans for how to take advantage of the next few days. Our patio door, which we probably open and close 20+ times a day, does not deal well with winter. The weather stripping, much abused by dog nails, fills with water and then freezes solid. Each time the door opens and closes, snow sticks to the bottom and causes an ice build-up. Neither of these things are conducive to a door that closes properly and is draft-free. So, goal #1 is to defrost and dry out the door! Goal #2 is to free our gates. Thanks to a good snow accumulation, they only open just enough for us to squeeze through, and each day the squeeze gets a little tighter! Finally, I have also fallen behind on shoveling off our deck and stairs. In particular the stairs have developed a very rounded profile which is perfect for skating down, as long as you don't mind the risk of ending up on your butt. So, goal #3 is to re-level the steps. There might be more, but three seems like a good number to aim for. 

The chickens are also looking forward to tomorrow as they heard that the solarium will be open for business.

Today's photo is from our afternoon dog walk. Just an amazing sky and my face didn't freeze! Since all photos are better with dogs in them, here is Seuss striking a pose.
