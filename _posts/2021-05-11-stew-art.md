Hi,

Things between Stew and I have been a bit tense over the last week or so. He is very rude, always coming over whenever I go into the pen. Then he watches me, and as soon as I turn my back, he rushes me. I have done some "wing moves" with my arms and I walk towards him until he backs off, but I don't think he was really put off at all. This morning I went in to make some adjustments to our new feeder. It is made out of PVC pipe, with an elbow at the bottom to make a sort of cup for the chickens to eat out of. Once it is all working well we'll be able to fill it up and forget it for a while, and also it should waste less food as they won't be able to flick it all over the place. Anyway, we decided to try it without glue between the PVC parts... big mistake! As I was adjusting it, the bottom came off and food started to pour out onto the ground. Thinking quickly, I put my hand underneath to stem the tide. Stew was also thinking quickly. As soon as he saw I was at a disadvantage, he rushed in and did his karate-chopping leg moves. He was quite serious and as I couldn't move, all I could do was sort of bat at him with my free hand. When I was finally able to cover the feeder and stand up, I realized he had drawn blood! Well, if I could have gotten my hands on him we would have had a mean stew for dinner tonight. As it was, he is very hard to catch. Lucky for him! He did get his comeuppance tonight though, in the form of a bath. Chris is taking him to a virtual pet parade tomorrow as part of the Recurse Center's Never Graduate week, so he had to look his best.

Today's photo is of me sitting on my birthday bench!

Hugs,<br />
