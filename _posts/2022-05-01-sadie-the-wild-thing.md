Everyone is alive. At least that's how Chris started his phone call to me on Thursday night. I was sitting in a hotel in High Prairie after giving a presentation and demo with Seuss to the Lesser Slave Lake Watershed Council. Chris was calling from Chaser while driving Sadie to our vet after finding her laying on the ground in our yard bleeding and in quite rough shape. It was one of the many moments where I have been very grateful that we have a vet so close. In the end, our vet had to call in her technician and the two of them stayed up stitching Sadie back together until 12 am that night. I was scheduled to go to Edmonton for some training this weekend, but I drove home instead so I could help nurse the patient. She looks like she has been through the wringer, but now that the morphine has worn off she is slowly returning to her normal self. This morning she ate her breakfast, which made me feel much better. We really have no idea what she had a fight with. The main suspects are beaver, badger, or martin. We have done a bit of investigating and put up some cameras, but no conclusive leads yet. It is a bit nerve wracking to have something like that happen right in our yard though.

One benefit of rushing home for the weekend was that it gave me a chance to make some progress on the summer coop renovations. Yesterday I disassembled the pen and took the coop off the base. The original plan was to lift the coop onto the deck so I could put it on the new base on a square and level surface. It quickly became apparent that we would not be lifting that beast anywhere! The new plan is to build the base on the deck, then try to scoot it under the coop in situ, then level it all before attaching it. Hopefully I can make some progress during the evenings this week. With the weather warming up we need to get the chickens out of the winter coop so I can convert the solarium into its summer role as the new greenhouse.

Today's photo is of Sadie recouping on the deck. This photo doesn't really show the extent of her injuries, but I felt it captured her tough warrior persona.
