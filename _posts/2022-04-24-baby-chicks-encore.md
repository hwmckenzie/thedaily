We had some excitement here today. We picked up some new baby chicks! They came from Moose Acres, the same place where we got our hatching eggs last year, but this year we decided to get them already hatched. Our chicks were hatched over Easter by people who wanted to experience the hatch, but didn't (or couldn't) raise the chickens. We met Chelsea from Moose Acres at the Ukrainian Village and picked six chicks out of a box of cute peeping fluff balls. While I put them in our car, Chris paid and by the time I got back he our change in had, in the form of chick number seven!

Today's photo is of the chicks all hunkered down for the night. So far they seem to prefer snuggling in a ball to the Mother Hen (heating pad) we constructed for them. Hopefully they find it if they need it. Seuss is happy to have the chick-TV back!

Hugs,<br />
