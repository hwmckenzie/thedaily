On this penultimate day of 2021, I wanted to write about our chickens. Certainly they have required a lot of work over the 1.5 years we've had them, but they have given back to us in turn. 

We've enjoyed their tasty and large eggs, and are currently experiencing an increase in laying. For two days in a row we've had 2 eggs (from our leghorns), and today Chris also observed what looked like a yolk on the poop board, so maybe someone else (our easter egger?) is trying to start laying again as well. Very welcome after a bit of a dry spell! We've also enjoyed a few tasty dinners, including our "Christmas dinner" tonight. Since we were away over Christmas, I decided to cook a chicken with trimmings to enjoy now that we are home. I cooked it whole in the instant pot (first time using this method), and it was just amazing. The meat fell right off the bone. After dinner when cleaning the carcass, I think I got 99% of the meat off and it was the easiest and least-messy of all my previous experiences! And of course, they are very entertaining to watch. I think at least two of the chickens we currently have actually like us and are happy to see us! 

Having chickens has also made us think more carefully about where our food comes from and what we choose to eat. It has raised questions for us about how we feel about the idea of animals as livestock instead of pets. I don't think we have answers to these questions yet, but I know our chickens will help us to find them. They have also inspired me to learn an awful lot about construction! So, as the end of this year approaches, I am grateful that we have chickens in our life.

Today's photo is of our barred rock rooster. We enjoyed watching him hatch and grow from a fluffy chick into a handsome guy. However, early on he showed aggression towards Chris and I, and so he ended his short, but good, life in our freezer this fall... and was likely on our dinner plates tonight. Thank you to this chicken.

Hugs,<br />
