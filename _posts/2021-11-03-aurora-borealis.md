The best part of today came right at the end.

This morning, Seuss and I headed off to Elk Island to spend some more time searching for wild boar scat. It was a bit chillier than last week, but still a very nice way to spend the day. No scat found, but we did find what I am pretty sure are tracks. We also saw a few more bison, and did have to detour around one burly gentleman, but luckily the others just watched us go by from a distance. They really are very large creatures!

The new chicken continues to integrate well with the flock, though she still prefers to sleep alone in the Chick-frame. She is also the first of our hens to get a name! I thought it would be neat to name her after the daughter of the lady we got her from. I checked to make sure it was ok (that was a a weird facebook message to write!), and it turns out the girl liked the idea. So, her name is Kashlyn. I'm not sure if she will go by Kash or Lyn for short, we'll have to see which seems to fit her better.

To wrap up the day, while I was driving home from fire practice I saw the northern lights! The first time in a long time we've seen them so bright. Since this was such a special treat they are the subject of today's photo. I don't consider myself a professional photographer, but my phone does have a night time setting which proved to work quite well. You can even seen the big dipper!

Hugs,<br />
