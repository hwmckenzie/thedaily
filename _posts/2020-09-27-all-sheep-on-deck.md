Hi,

Just a photo today. I was looking through some of the photos Chris has taken since I've been in Manitoba. There are some really good ones, but I had to share this one of the sheep climbing up onto our deck. This must be Bold Sheep. As you can see, Revi is monitoring the situation closely from inside. I expect she did not approve of this development, unless the sheep was coming to ask Chris if Revi could come out and play. You can see Spray Paint in the background, so she seems to have recovered from your earlier incident, despite not sticking around for her full course of antibiotics. I think our sheep have become quite used to their nomadic ways and are going to resist being confined to only a portion of our yard. Perhaps there will be a fall rebellion? However, hopefully once winter arrives we will have the upper hand as we are in possession of a round hay bale and they are not!

Hugs,
Hannah
