Hello!

Quite the late night for me! Things are ramping up quickly at work and tomorrow is our first ever online training for watercraft inspectors. We're following up with some in-person training at the inspection stations, but in this time of covid we are trying to do as much online delivery as possible. Tomorrow's session is the first of few for various different groups of returning and new inspectors. I am tasked with giving the presentation on the aquatic invasive species legislation... Not exactly a topic to keep you on the edge of your seat... or in you seat... in fact, generally this lecture ends with most people crumpled into a heap on the floor with their eyes crossed! Hopefully my attempt at it will keep everyone engaged, or at least conscious.

I still have plans for a greenhouse tour, but today's photo is from our walk this morning. I didn't realize that Chris took this photo, and it was a nice surprise to see when I sat down to write this email. A girl and her dog walking down a valley trail on a spring morning. It doesn't get much better than that :)

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
