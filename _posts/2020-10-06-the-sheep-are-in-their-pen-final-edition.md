Hi,

Today I fortified the sheep fence. I ran a wire along the bottom of the snow fence and pegged it into the ground at intervals. I also ran string along the top of the snow fence to help it stand up and appear higher, and hopefully more intimidating?! I also made two gates which don't require multiple bungee cords in complex configurations to close. Once all that was done, I got out my oats and went in search of the sheep. It took a little to convince them they wanted oats more than a nap (mid day is always a hard time to get their attention!), but once moving they followed me into the pen happily enough. And why not? They know they can get out. Or at least they could before the improvements. If this fence is breached, I think the sheep may have bested me. They went into the pen at about 2 pm this afternoon and I just checked now and they are still there. This is promising as I'm sure they would rather be back in their original shed for the night. Of course they could enjoy the comforts of their new shed, but so far they seem to be wary of it. Hopefully as they acclimate to their new pen they will get more comfortable with the shed as well. The dogs are all very sleepy tonight as they were outside all day today for the first time in a long time.

Today's photo is of the sheep in their pen, demonstrating their distrust of the shed. 

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
