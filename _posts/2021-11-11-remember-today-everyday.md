It was a gray day today, as it almost always is for Remembrance Day. I started out the day reading an article written by the dad of one of my high school friends, Sarah Angus, which was published in the Globe and Mail's [link](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/first-person/article-war-records-told-me-so-much-more-about-the-father-i-never-really-knew/ "First Person") column yesterday. Quite a moving piece about his bittersweet discovery of a hidden part of his father's life, and the impact WWII had on his family which he was unaware of until many years later. Makes me realize that I don't know who in my family went to war.

Later in the day I wrote an email to my MP, the second I have ever written. It was about my concern for the Afghan interpreters and their families, and my desire for the government to do more to help them get to safety. Even when the war is over, or abandoned, its impact continues for generations. How lucky I am to be safe enough that I can focus my concern on people an ocean away. How lucky I am to be free to voice my thoughts to my government without fear of reprisal. Lest we forget.

Today's photo is of a volunteer poppy which popped up this summer next to the box where I've planted them in previous years, even though nothing grew in the box itself this year except for weeds.

Hugs,<br />
