Hi,

I'm not sure if it is the warm weather, or just a coincidence, but we've had lots of excitement here the last few days.

The sheep have started getting particularly feisty in the evenings. I have no idea what inspires them to do it, but they run back and forth over the bales in their area as if they were in a steeplechase. We captured some [video of their antics](https://youtu.be/b9_axFl1h-4) if you're interested to see how weird our sheep are!

We've also spotted some new birds. A few days ago Chris saw a black-backed woodpecker outside his office. This is a really neat sighting as they are quite rare where we live. Today the rooster spotted a northern goshawk and did a good job alerting Chris and I to the intruder. Luckily we scared it off before it could grab any of the chickens, but it did come back once more so we have definitely peaked its interest. I'm not sure how the rooster is able to keep track of all his ladies and watch the skies, but he was working hard at it today. The weather was fantastic, so all the chickens were out under the bird feeder and foraging all over. No wonder he sleeps so soundly at night! I also saw what I think was a great gray owl twice today. The first time it was sitting on one of our fence posts, and then the dogs and I saw it again coming home at the end of our walk. It was so amazing to watch it fly away in complete silence! I hope it makes its home nearby so we can see it more often.

Today's photo is Seuss's birthday post on the Government of Alberta's My Wild Alberta facebook page. The birthday boy got lots of likes and birthday wishes from his fans, all of whom he has worked with. 

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
