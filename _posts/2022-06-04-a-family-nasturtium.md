I walked around the garden tonight to see what new things were popping up. I think we're getting into the time now where things change daily, and maybe even hourly! The big discovery for this evening was some nasturtiums poking through into the light. These are not just any nasturtiums. They came from seeds which were progeny of plants in my uncle Bob's garden in Nova Scotia last summer, which he harvested and dried and then mailed across the country to me, where I kept them over winter and planted them about 10 days ago. Talk about special!

Today's photo is of one of the little nasturtiums. So far there are three.
