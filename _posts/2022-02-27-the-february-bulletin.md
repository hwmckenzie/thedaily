I can't believe it has been three weeks since my last post! On the one hand it seems like yesterday that Riblet arrived at the beginning of the month, and on the other hand so much has happened I feel that surely it must have been longer. I'll try my best to catch everyone up with the daily happenings in this February Bulletin edition of The Daily.

It feels right to start with an update about Riblet as she has captured the attention of everyone in the house this month. She is recovering well from her demodectic mange and gets cuter by the day. I first realized that her hair was growing back when I noticed she suddenly had bushy white eyebrows! She still has some bare and thin patches on her neck and legs, but overall her coat is looking much better and she looks less like a wrinkled and wizened old lady and more like the puppy she is. She also continues to show that she is a very good puppy, and has won over all the dogs. Even Sadie plays with her now, and quite energetically! Given her progress, this week it came time to put her up for adoption on the SCARS website. This led to much discussion and soul searching by Chris and I, the conclusion of which was that last night we decided to adopt Riblet ourselves. No surprise to any of my readers I'm sure!

We've been seeing some signs around the property that spring is on the horizon. Early in the month the dogs and I encountered a very large and grumpy beaver on one of our walks. It was quite lucky that I saw the beaver first and was able to leash all the dogs in time. I'm sure that Sadie would have been very keen to renew acquaintances and grievances! I stopped to take a photo, which proved to be a bad decision as it gave everyone a chance to get suitably excited, during which Riblet wrapped her leash all around my legs and I lost a glove. With the beaver staring us down and menacing an advance, we retreated inelegantly, the glove left to be retrieved at a later date! Easter also arrived early at the property, heralded by the first egg from our Easter egger hen since August! One day Chris came back from the coop with a blue egg, and she's laid an egg almost every day since. In the absence of a prophesying groundhog, I'm taking this as a sign that spring is not too far off. The last nature report I'll share from the property was captured by one of our trail cameras in January (we are a bit behind in reviewing our photos!). We were lucky enough to see a Canada lynx traveling along one of our trails, on the hunt for snowshoe hares no doubt! This is a first for us and it feels very special to know that such animals share our property.

I spent a bit of time away from the property this month. Seuss and I have been shadowing two of the Edmonton Police K9 teams as they complete their detection training, which has meant a few trips to Edmonton. It is very interesting to see how they train their dogs. There are many similarities to how Seuss and I work, but also some differences. Seuss was invited to participate in some training exercises and got to demonstrate his skills, though it took him (and me!) a bit of time to relax in the new environment. Last week we did a search at Edmonton Police headquarters, where we had the chance to educate some top level Edmonton Police executives, who had come to watch the drug dogs, about aquatic invasive species and zebra mussels! My last visit coincided with Riblet's vet check-up and her assessment by a SCARS trainer, so Chris and I packed up all the dogs and headed to Edmonton for a night. It certainly is a production to take three country dogs and one excitable puppy to the big city. I always forget how crazy they get and how long it takes to walk down the street when you have to stop to sniff and pee with every step! 

We returned home from that little trip just in time to pack for a bigger one. After two years for sticking close to home, Chris and I are hopping a plane today to visit his Grandpo in California! Yesterday we packed all the dogs into Chaser, put our luggage in the roof box (since there was no more space in the cab!) and took the dogs to the kennel (fingers crossed they all have a safe stay and don't hold it against us!). Although we were quite tired by the time we arrived at the Renaissance hotel at the airport, we are enjoying a relaxing morning while we wait to board our flight. By tonight I'll be asking myself, what snow? If you want to read about our California adventures, I'll be posting about those over on [The Property Report](https://propertyreport.upnix.com/).

The photo to accompany this bulletin is of the dogs catching up on the news during their trip to Edmonton.
