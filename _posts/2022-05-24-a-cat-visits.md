Another good day of recovering while gardening. I accomplished a momentous thing, which has been "in-progress" (loosely speaking!) for several years. However, I still have to put on the finished touches, so I'll save that story for a night when I can share a photo of the finished product.

We had a small cat visit us today. I think it tried to come in our yard to go after the baby chicks, but Seuss saw it and chased after it so fast he almost went head first into the fence when it slipped through just ahead of him! It ran under my van to hide, so after I put the dogs inside I went over to say hello. It turned out to be a very friendly cat (baby chick hunting notwithstanding). Hopefully it doesn't want to hang around our place for too long as I fear our yard is not overly cat friendly.

Today's photo is another one of Riblet. She had a big day today as she went to the vet to get spayed. Here she is contemplating getting out of Chaser after returning home.

Hugs,<br />
