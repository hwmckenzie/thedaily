Good evening!

A quick email tonight as I am all done in from (on-going) coop finalization. Chris sorted out a very ingenious way to get the wheels on, and so we managed to heave and ho it out of the yard. The dogs are happy as now they can go outside again unattended and I am happy as I don't have to be the dog attendant! I have to say, the coop is a beast, so early impressions suggest we will not be moving it around regularly as originally thought. It also seems to have undergo some mysterious twisting and torquing during its short journey, and now the person door to the run no longer closes without the assistance of a bungee cord. Clearly some kinks to work out!

But, we hit a chicken milestone today as the chickens have now laid one dozen (plus one) eggs while in our care! Three of those were today, so they seem to approve of their new accommodation. At the moment they are laying in the corner of the coop on the floor, so we will have to do some work to convince them that the better place to lay is in the nest boxes, built for that exact purpose! They also don't seem to care for roosting yet... odd birds.

Aside from chicken related activities, the dogs and I started back to our routine of taking afternoon walks. The prairie crocuses are suddenly in full bloom on our hill, and today's photo is of Sadie laying in the crocuses.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
