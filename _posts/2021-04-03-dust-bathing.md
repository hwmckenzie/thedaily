Hi,

Chris and I did our first outdoor chores this afternoon. Clearly we are out of practice as we are pooped after only a few hours of light outdoor work! You know who is not tired? The chicks! They get a second wind about 9pm and chirp away in their cage as we try to go to sleep. The big excitement tonight is the new addition of the dust bath. It was quite the hit and a much contested for amenity! It was neat to watch them dust bathing within minutes of the sand being put in their kennel. Like everything else they do, it is all instinct as they don't have a mother hen demonstrating any behaviours for them. Last night they slept in a pile in a corner. I'm not sure why they aren't sleeping in their heating pad cave anymore. I almost never see them use it now, but they sit on top of it so I assume they would use it if they needed to. 

That is all for tonight as I can't wait to get into bed!

Today's photo is the chicks in their dust bath.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
