Hi!

Winter came to us today, for real. We woke up to a snowfall warning in action. I think we got about 20 cm today and it is still going as I write. This frozen precipitation continued to propel the chicken coop construction team, who is already burning the candle at both ends! After packing it in last night in the dark, this morning we finished putting up the plywood interior walls and the chicken door. So, the coop is now closed to the weather. Due to imminent really cold temperatures, we decided to leave the painting until spring. In an effort to dry things out, this afternoon we put the heater from Chris's office in there while Hannah added the roosts and a droppings board, which apparently should make it easier to clean. Tomorrow we'll put in the floor (discounted vinyl from our friendly Vermilion flooring company!), add some sort of temporary nest boxes, and food and water. We have plans for additional enrichment items, TBD, but these will have to wait. We are planning to have the chickens in the coop tomorrow night, though their heater won't arrive until Monday at the earliest. But at least it is insulated, unlike their current summer coop accommodations. 

That all being said, the chickens were very bold today and all ventured out in the snow. Despite all the white stuff, they still visited a few of their regular haunts and spent quite a bit of time under the deck. I was impressed! They are now all tucked in for the night. Hopefully they are just as happy tomorrow night in their new coop!

Today's photo is of a visitor to our dugout. I expect he (or she) has designs on our chickens if we ever let our guard down and forget to close their door at night.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
