We returned from California last night and made the final leg of our journey home today. After overnighting in Edmonton, we picked the dogs up at the kennel this morning and arrived home to a heavy blanket of fresh snow. We were very happy to see the dogs and they were very happy to see us! We spent the rest of the day doing the regular "get home and get back to the daily routine" type things. Now I am looking forward to the weekend. Facebook reminded me today that this time last year I already had some seedlings started, so I am hoping to do a bit of planning over the weekend and then get in touch with Lemonee to see if she is willing to start some plants for me again this year. I am planning to try out some new growing methods which are supposed to be "low maintenance". Stay tuned!

In case you are interested, I spent a bit of time this afternoon adding some posts about our California trip to the [The Property Report](https://propertyreport.upnix.com/).

Today's photo is of the dogs moments after we go them all into the van and pulled away from the kennel!

Hugs,<br />
