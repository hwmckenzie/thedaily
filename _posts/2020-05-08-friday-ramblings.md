Hi!

Friday! Although it doesn't really have the same meaning as it used to. You know what else doesn't mean the same thing? Summer. Chris and I watched a movie tonight about some high school kids experiencing their last summer before going off to college (classic story line!). Partway through the movie, after the main character meets the girl of his dreams and they have a falling out, but before they make up, the businesses around town started advertising about "Back to school". Even after so many years away from school, those three words still conjure up a very ominous feeling of "the fun is coming to an end, so you better enjoy every moment of it!" To continue this little ramble, I think that is how Revi must have felt at the end of her walk yesterday. We got all the way around our loop and home with 100% of the dogs. Then I had a few moments of inattention as I checked in on the chickens, and in those moments Revi and Tammi decided they fancied a second loop! By the time Chris checked on his phone to see where they were (you may recall our purchase of the Tractives last summer), they had crossed the slew and were over a quarter section away heading south at speed! However, thanks to the Tractives, we were able to continue with our morning routine of dog feeding and coffee making, all while watching their little dots move away, and away, and away... but then slowly start to make their way back towards home, and finally the two of them were standing outside our front door wagging their tails and looking to see if we were bringing them their breakfast. Rotten Revi and Toodle-oo-Tammi indeed!

Today's sourdough starter report is very positive. The bootcamp recipe for today was for popovers (similar to yorkshire puddings), something I had never made before, and they turned out quite well! This recipe was extra exciting as it also used three eggs... which were laid by our chickens! Tomorrow I am to make savory scones, which is good because they use a lot of starter. I have been watching it all day since I fed it this morning and the amount of bubbling and the increase in volume is a bit concerning. It reminds me of the time Melinda and I made overnight pizza dough and it exploded out of its saran wrap during the night and took over part of the fridge. People make scifi movies out of that kind of thing!

Today's photo is of Revi and Tammi when they showed up at our door after their solo walk yesterday morning. Revi had to suffer through a hose down before being admitted into the house! The paw plunger was just not up to the task.

Hugs,<br />
