Hi,

It rained today! I think this is the first rain we've had this year, with the exception of a few drops here and there. Even tonight wasn't very much, but still worth celebrating. I am excited for the grass to grow so I can stop worrying whether the sheep have enough to eat. I'm sure soon I will worry that they have too much to eat and can't keep up!

Today's photo is of the chickens checking out their Chickshaw. It has been in their pen for a few days now. At least one hen has laid an egg in there. Tonight Chris and I are planning to move them from the coop to the Shaw once they have gone to bed. Should be exciting! You can see the darn tube feeder that gave me so much trouble to the left of the door. This photo was before it decided to fall apart, pour feed on the ground, and leave me at the mercy of Stew. Its on the list to fix this weekend!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
