Hi,

I am looking forward to a good sleep tonight. Last night my sleep was interrupted by quite the gale outside. The temperature got very warm overnight and the wind came up. This also resulted in snow avalanching off our roof. Neither of these meteorological conditions are approved by the dogs. As a result there is a traffic jam in the bathroom, which is apparently the safest spot in the house. Sadie won out, and so Seuss had to settle with growling at the wind, intermingled with an occasional bark. It was at this point that I moved to the couch, to provide moral support and demonstrate deep relaxed breathing in the hopes the dogs would go to sleep. Sadie's life improved greatly when Chris got up to go to the bathroom and brought her bed in for her. Seuss seemed to be helped by the deep breathing, and after a while I heard a big sigh, which is the cue he has decided to give up fighting and go to sleep. Shortly after this I climbed the ladder and returned to my warm bed. I did wonder briefly what the sheep and chickens were thinking of the wind, but did not investigate further. I guess they don't hold as much sway in the household as the dogs!

I have recently benefited from the covid lockdown. With the restrictions on in-person activities, a yoga studio in Edmonton is offering quite a few classes over Zoom. So, today is my second Tuesday of attending yoga via the internet! It was quite odd the first time, but I am getting used to it now and quite enjoy it. I know there has always been yoga you could stream online anytime you wanted, but somehow as this is in real time, and they encourage everyone to turn their video on, it feels quite different. Very companionable I suppose.

Chris and I also went on a covid-safe date tonight. We drove to Vegreville, ordered Dairy Queen at the drive-through, then drove to the "the egg" (which is a very large pysanka in a park in town), and sat in the dark in Chaser listening to podcasts. It was the first installment in the "Twelve Dates of Christmas". We listened to the first chapter of "S-town", which is about investigating a murder that was covered up, and an episode of "Lore" which was about quarantine, exorcism, and the orchestrated death of some priest in the 17 century. Quite romantic!

Today's photo is from a little while ago, but features three out of five sheep enjoying their hay from on top of the bale! Silly sheep.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
