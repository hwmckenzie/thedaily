Hi,

Lots of action here over the last few days. The biggest news is that the chicks have moved outside for good! We spent the day on Saturday putting the finishing touches on the summer coop and they spent their first night outside on Saturday night. They really seem to enjoy being outside, but they aren't very good about going into the coop at night. On the first night we had to put them to bed. It was a two person job with one of us catching them and the other stopping the captives from escaping back out the door. Last night I managed it on my own, but only by closing the door between depositing chicks inside. It is still pretty chilly at night so we have them set up with a heater and their mother hen. 

With the chicks settled outside, the next job is to get the chickshaw done so we can start moving the big chickens around. I made some progress on the shaw on Sunday and last night. I decided to use vinyl siding for the sides of the shaw as I found a piile of by one of our sheds. I am glad it is just a shaw I am doing as while it is pretty easy to install, I think it would be quite difficult to install well! I wouldn't want me putting siding on our house for example!

So that's the news. Dominated by chickens at the moment, but I foresee a shift to plants in the near future. We picked up two cantaloupe seedlings from Lemonee tonight. I think she is itching to get the plants she started for me out of her house. Their kitchen is quite a jungle! So, getting the greenhouse set up is next on my list.

Today's photo is of the chicks in their new digs.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
