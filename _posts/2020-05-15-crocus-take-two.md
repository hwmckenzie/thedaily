Hello!

Long weekend Friday! I had to ask  my coworker yesterday what holiday this was when he mentioned that Monday was a day off. It occurred to me that this is the first May long weekend I have taken off since Seuss and I started with the boat inspection program. Chris and I plan to spend it working on outside in our garden. For my indoor activity, I have started my first real loaf of sourdough bread. It is a two day recipe. Last night I "activated" my starter and just now I made "the sponge". Tomorrow following various kneadings and risings I will bake it, and hopefully it will turn out edible!

Today's photo is a retake of yesterday's as based on some feedback I think it failed to send. So, hopefully tonight you can enjoy a photo of the first domestic crocus to emerge in our garden. The wild ones have been up for a week or so now. 

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
