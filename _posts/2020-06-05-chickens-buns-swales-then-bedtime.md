Hello!

A very busy day for us at the property. Since I have now switched over to working weekends, today was a day off... from work at least. No rest for the wicked when it comes to yard work! Despite initially feeling sleepy after the dog walk, we rallied well. We did so many different things, I'm not sure where to begin!

I guess I will start with a chicken update. The chicken we isolated yesterday and bathed did well overnight. She hasn't laid an egg yet, but we decided we would put her back with the flock today as she seemed peppy. Fingers crossed! The isolation crate wasn't empty for long as we corralled "bare butt" to see if we could identify what might be plaguing her. We have long felt she had a very hard crop, and wonder if this is linked to her lack of feathers. After some reading online, we decided to treat her with a combination of crop massage and bread soaked in olive oil. She was not a big fan of the crop massage at first, but after I improved my technique a bit, she seemed to sort of like it, and stretched up her neck. As soon as I released her, she pooped, which seems promising? She spent the day in the crate and has eaten and had water. No eggs yet, soft or hard shelled. We plan to administer another massage before we go to bed and keep her inside overnight for continued observation. The rest of the flock are enjoying a nice clean coop tonight. We took out all the straw out and laid down the vinyl flooring I got from the super nice owner of Toma Floors in Vermilion. As a side note, he was quite happy to get the dozen eggs in return, and said he had told his wife all about it. Instead of straw, we have switched to using all shavings, so it smells quite nice in there! We also cleaned all the food and water containers, and wiped down the walls which had some old blood on them from the chapped comb phase. It is looking really good in there!

I also have a sourdough update for today. I made hamburger buns! We ate them tonight with burgers. Very tasty! But, quite a lot of work. Luckily the recipe made 16 buns. At the time I was cursing the large amount of sticky dough I had to try to tame on the counter, but now I am feeling pretty good as I can freeze the rest and not have to make more any time soon!

To round things out, we did some outdoor work. Chris swapped out the winter tires on the van, checked the air pressure on the spare, and reattached a piece of plastic from the undercarriage which had come loose, and we subsequently pulled off. It is not entirely clear to me what its role is... but probably best to avoid shedding vehicle parts ifd possible! While Chris was tackling the van, I dug a "swale" along the back of the willow bushes beside our deck. A swale is basically a level trench. We put weeping tile in it (a plastic pipe with holes in it), covered it with caragana wood chips, and then filled it with water. The idea is that it helps water infiltrate into the ground, providing moisture to the roots of what you plant along the berm of the swale. So the willows won't need any watering and will hopefullly grow well and be low maintenance... That is if I can stop the dogs from stepping on the when the launch themselves on and off the deck. The weeping tile also acts as a big space underground where you can store water. We are very concerned about storing water as 2" of rain are forecast over the next three days and we are guaranteed to run out of rain barrels and tank space.

So, quite a big day. I expect there will be a lot of groaning when we lay down in bed tonight!

Today's photo is from a trail camera we have set up in the conservation area. Three moose! It is from May 18th, but we just picked up the card today.

Hugs,<br />
