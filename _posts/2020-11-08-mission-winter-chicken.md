Hi,

Well, the winter chicken coop is finally done and the chickens are all moved in. Talk about a marathon! And like all good projects, there are a few outstanding items, but I think we'll defer them to the second quarter of 2021, or the staff will strike. We finished the final push at about 6 pm tonight. Once the finishing touches were complete, we moved the chickens over from their summer coop. This was accomplished by catching them, somewhat aided by the fact that they thought it was bedtime and were settled in to sleep, carrying them to the coop, and letting them get settled in a bit before turning out the lights. Chris even had to rescue one chicken from under the deck. She apparently decided that sleeping outside was a good trade-off to avoid walking across the snow to get back to the coop. I'm not sure she had very sound reasoning on that one given it is supposed to drop to -17Â°C tonight. The heater for our winter coop has not arrived, but at least it is insulted and much less drafty than the summer coop. Everyone settled in well and looks to be happy on our chicken camera.

After the chicken move was completed, I came inside and sunk into a bath while Chris put pizza in the oven and made us moscow mules. I think it will take me a few days to recover from this project. I certainly learned a lot about construction, including how long it takes to build things, and that I should not quit my day job!

Today's photo is a view of our coop from the chicken camera. Everyone is getting settled in and checking out the new digs. Certainly an upgrade from last night's accommodation!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
