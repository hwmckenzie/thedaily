Hello,

Today we managed a very rare achievement. We went to Vegreville and we accomplished some things at home! Normally when we go to Vegreville it ends up always taking the whole day. By the time we get home and put away the groceries, it is time to start dinner. I'm not sure what our secret to success was today, but when we got home Chris mowed around our trees and I assembled, filled, and planted a garden box! This is not one of our deck boxes (still under construction), but one of the boxes we are setting up in the dog run for veggies that need large spaces, like our squashes and pumpkins. Fingers crossed they have a good first night in their new bed and are looking perky tomorrow morning. They are much hardier than the cucumbers and tomatoes, so I think they'll be fine. Hopefully I will get a few others assembled tomorrow for our cabbages, potatoes, and onions.

The other thing that was interesting about going to town was that I wore a mask. We will be wearing masks as part of our health and safety procedures once we are back at work since we spend our whole day speaking with lots of people who are passing through our inspection station. So, I wanted to get used to wearing one. There are very few people wearing them around town, so I definitely felt a little self-conscious. I did sort of forget about it eventually, but it makes my glasses fall down my nose, so I'll either have to wear a strap (the epitome of uncool!) or wear my contacts.

It got quite hot here today, and at the moment we are inside surrounded by panting dogs. I'll have to open some windows to get the magical "cross breeze" going. Good thing we got all the screens put in again for summer as the mosquitoes and noseeums have made their appearance.

Today's photo is from our dog walk. We are starting to see lots of flowers around our property and the conservation area. Some are familiar now as we see them each year, though I usually have to look up their names. The flowers seem particularly good this year, so the conditions must have been favorable. The flower featured in today's photo is one we see all the time, the kinnikinnick or common bearberry. There is a whole carpet of it along one of the paths we walk, but this morning was the first time I have seen the flower, so it was a real treat to spot! I also managed to get a berry in this photo, so quite a good one! I have been nursing some kinnikinnick along in my garden, but while it is prevalent in the wilderness of our property, it is a reluctant garden resident and is not doing very well so far.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
