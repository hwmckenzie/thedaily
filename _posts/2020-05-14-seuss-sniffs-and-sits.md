Hi,

Seuss and I had a very exciting day today. There was a boat that came back from the US when the borders were closing that was found to have mussels on it. The owner finished his 14 day self-isolation and our team was scheduled to decontaminate his boat today. Luckily for Seuss and I, the owner lived near Vermilion, so we got to be part of the action. Seuss gave the boat a sniff and alerted to tell me he found mussels. I wasn't able to see any mussels in the first spot he picked (although someone else did see one later... a bit easier when you don't have a big furry head trying to help you!), but I did see some in the second spot, so I was able to pay him for all his hard work with his favourite ball. Pretty exciting! For all the boats his sniffs, it is very rare that he gets to actually find what he is looking for.

Hard to believe it is already Thursday night. Tomorrow morning I am working at the home office as usual, but then in the afternoon Marlene, Heather, and Pen (Heather's dog) are coming with a picnic lunch, wood specially procured for our new garden boxes, and some plants that Marlene has been starting for us. This will be a nice visit, and also the start of a busy weekend for us!

Today's photo is of a crocus which recently emerged in one of our garden boxes along the path to Chris's office shed. There are a few others that might flower this weekend. It still gets quite chilly overnight, so most things are taking their time in starting up. Not the grasses and weeds of course! Although, I did come across a book available online called ["Weeds, Guardians of the Soil"](http://www.journeytoforever.org/farm_library/weeds/WeedsToC.html#contents), which I have started reading. Perhaps it will change my relationship with the members of this group which are quite plentiful in my garden, and who I have historically been in conflict with.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
