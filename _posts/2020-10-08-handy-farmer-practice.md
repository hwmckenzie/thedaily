Hi,

Today was a big construction day that (mostly) went smoothly! Chris had some errands in Edmonton (including a Home Depot run for our chickens), so it was just me and the animals at home for the day. I started by trying to transform one of our blue barrels from a composter (which was only mildly successful) into a hay feeder for the sheep. I have been warned that they are messy, so I am hoping to avoid wastage. The project went ok, but I was foiled at the end because the bolts I was hoping to reuse from the composter were so corroded that I had to cut most of them off. So, to finish that will require a trip to the hardware store. As a side note, I did give the sheep some hay tonight in their half done feeder, and they started eating it right away. That made me wonder if the grass is pretty much done for the season and they are hungry? 

Next up was progress on the chicken coop. After much measuring and calculating and sketching I completed the framing for one wall, which also has a long narrow vent at the top. Good thing I am not framing a house as (a) it would take me forever and, (b) I don't think my framing is entirely structurally sound! With today's practice I hope I am ready to tackle the other wall tomorrow, which features the additional challenge of a real window which I need to install eventually. I also expect some visible progress tomorrow as I now have the materials to complete the floor, which means I can start putting up walls as they are completed.

The final project was to hang the radiant heater we have for the chickens, aptly named "Cosy Coop", in front of their roost. It is supposed to go down to -1Â°C tonight and I worry about them as their summer coop is pretty drafty. Everything I read says that chickens are quite hardy, but still, our leghorns are a less hardy breed, and this is the coldest weather we've had this fall. Anyway, it required several acrobatic feats and yoga maneuvers to get the thing hung. It was quite exciting as the chickens were in the process of trying to go to bed and were not impressed with the human head and torso that kept popping in and out of their coop uttering curses! There was much clucking and fluffing. After trying to wing it, I finally surrendered and went to get the measuring tape, which of course resulted in the heater getting hung and me admitting that I should have just used it to start with!

Today's photo is of about this time last year when many of us were in PEI for the family gathering, in part as a belated celebration of Chris and I's wedding. A wonderful weekend! Sad to think it would not even be a possibility this year, which makes me all the more thankful we got to see everyone last fall.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
