This morning was the first New Year's morning I met without Sadie in a long time. The idea of my adventure continuing without her is a bit unsettling. I've been thinking about her a lot over the Christmas holiday and reflecting on all the Christmases we enjoyed together over the years. Looking through photos, it was pretty amazing to reflect on all the different places we celebrated Christmas. 

In Edmonton we spent a Christmas at the yellow door house with Sadie's cat friend Horatio. After that we had Christmas at Melinda's where we treated all the dogs to a full Christmas dinner. Those were the days! The next two years were spent on the north side of the river at Aaron and Huong's, though Tammi and Sadie came with Chris and I to Jasper the second year we were there. In 2015 Spike and Seuss joined us and we left Edmonton to live at the cabin at the lake for the winter before moving to our property. We had lots of good Christmases here at the property, though we did leave Sadie in a kennel one year when we went with the Camerons on a cruise (gasp!). The next year was a busy one with Jess and Bailey coming to stay with us in our tiny cabin over Christmas. This was also Revi's first Christmas with us. We laid low at home in 2020, which was also our first Christmas witout Tammi. The following year we took all three (!) dogs to Jasper to join Marlene and Ron and the Innes'. After that we had a Christmas at the property with Jaxx, and then last year we also had a pretty relaxed Christmas at home.

From looking through photos, the things that stay the same from year are time spent together, enjoying the snow, opening presents (humans and dogs!), and food. They were all good times. While we missed Sadie this year, I know she was here in spirit.

I've included a photo of her taking in the moutain scenery while enjoying Christmas in Jasper. Winter was Sadie's favourite season.

Hugs,<br />
