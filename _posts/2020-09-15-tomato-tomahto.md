Hi,

Today we completed the sheep shed! I have to come clean and say that I did have some additional help yesterday and this morning. We paid one of the "kids" (he's about 18!) we know from the fire department, Brett, to work with me yesterday and he came back this morning to finish up the metal roof. It was great! Once I get my design finalized for the winter chicken coop I think I'll see if he wants to come back. I do have the floor framed already, but I'm having trouble figuring out how tall it should be and where the door and windows will go. The word is starting to spread as well and we have been the lucky recipients of some building materials from our front field neighbor (turns out there was something of value in his junk pile!) and one of the ladies on the fire department who used to be a carpenter. 

Tonight I had to take a break from construction projects to harvest our tomatoes, as it is forecast to go below zero overnight. They are in the greenhouse, but I didn't want to risk it. I picked all the ripe ones and most of the large green ones. There are quite a few little green ones left and some big, so maybe they'll survive and get a few more days of ripening outside. I found a few bonus cucumbers and peppers hiding at the back amongst the tomatoes as well. Some of the peppers even turned red... I think I better be careful with those ones though as perhaps they get hot when they change color. While I harvested I had an audience of sheep. They have been grazing up near the house quite a bit over the last few days. As long as I pretend not to look at them, they seem to stick around and I can surreptitiously sneak glances to try to see if I can tell if they are doing ok. The dogs are not impressed with this situation as it means they have to spend more time in the house.

Today's photo is of the tomato haul. All I need is some basil, balsamic vinegar, olive oil and fresh mozzarella and I could practically be in Italy!

Hugs,
Hannah
