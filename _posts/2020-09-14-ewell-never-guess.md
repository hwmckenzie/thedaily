Hi,

Big progress was made today in the construction department! The sheep shed is teetering on the edge of completion. The remaining item is to attach the metal roof, which will hopefully happen tomorrow. Then we'll just have to figure out how to move it to the winter pen area we have set up. The sheep voluntarily spent a lot of their winter pen today, so that is promising. I say voluntarily as we haven't finished setting up the fence yet so there was still a gap where they could come and go. 

Tomorrow I am back to work after enjoying a long weekend. But, luckily I will be working from  home, so I can still enjoy a hot lunch and multiple coffees if I like. Quite the treat!

As I type this, Chris is cutting up what might be the third last watermelon of the year. I can confidently say there will be at least two more after this one as they are already stockpiled in our fridge. We don't fool around when it comes to watermelon!

Today's photo shows the current status of the sheep shed.

Hugs,
Hannah
