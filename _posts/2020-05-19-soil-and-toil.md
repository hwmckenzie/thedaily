Hi,

After taking a day off from working on our greenhouse, we got back to it today. The pressure is on as we have many baby plants anxiously awaiting the move from their tiny pots to their big summer bed. We picked up some replacement PVC pipe, so now have most of our structure in place. The final piece, a difficult to find joint that connects part of the roof, is on its way in the mail thanks to Marlene sourcing it for us in Edmonton. So, this evening after working up some motivation (or as Jen and other Lord of the Rings fans might say, "mustering the Rohirrim!"), I dug into the hill. And lo it was full of good soil! Not wanting to transplant the top layer of quack grass into the new bed, I lovingly dug out blocks of the sod layer and gently shook it over the wheelbarrow, picking out any white roots I could see. I am sure some made it through, but hopefully not too many! I wheeled this to the bed and added it on top of the straw layer, which was over the cardboard layer. Then I repeated this process of harvesting soil three more times! The shaking on the third trip may have been more business-like and less loving! Hard to believe how much soil the bed can hold. Hopefully I have gotten a good mix in there of soil and other organics in the form of straw. I guess the proof will be in the produce! I topped the bed off with a layer of leaves and a layer of straw to hold the leaves in place, and then watered the whole thing. Fingers crossed the heavy mulching on top will help keep the weeds down. So, one bed down, two more to go... and then two more beside the deck... and then a few more in our dog run, which we are planning to convert into a squash-a-torium. Perhaps I should set up the hammock!

Today's photo is of my constant gardening companion, patiently but doggedly waiting for me to play with him in between shovels of soil. As you can see, his strategy for gaining my attention is the opposite of understated!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
