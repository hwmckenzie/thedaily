June was the month that I decided I would not grow any vegetables this summer, aside from the things in the greenhouse. I came to this conclusion as I was shoveling dirt from mud mountain into a wheelbarrow and pushing it over to where I had set up my vegetable garden boxes. While huffing and puffing during a break between loads, I saw the light. The next day I posted all of my garden box corners and existing boxes to be given away on a local facebook group. A few days later I dropped them off at someone's house and I never looked back! I don't think it happened in June, but at some point this summer I came to the conclusion that instead of doing it all ourselves, we could connect with others in our community who were growing food and raising animals. This led me to seek out a market gardener living in Innisfree. We got a vegetable box from him weekly throughout the summer. The veggies were delicious and grown locally, and I didn't have to stress about them! 

Today's photo is of some mountain goats I saw in June while working with Seuss near Canmore doing shoreline searches. While it is relatively common to see wild sheep in the area, it is quite rare to see mountain goats. It was very hot near the end of June and I had originally booked us a place to stay which did not have air conditioning. Needless to say, we moved accommodation the next day and very much enjoyed our A/C after working outside all morning. I did feel a bit guilty though as Chris was at home cooking with Sadie and Revi.
