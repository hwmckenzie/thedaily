Seuss and I were away for a few days doing some training with our teammates in Calgary. Since I am taking a more laid back approach to writing my blog this fall, I decided to take a few days off from writing. And I can still say "fall", at least until tomorrow. Hard to believe that the last few weeks of snow and frozen nose hairs are considered part of the same season as changing leaves and crisp mornings!

Chris was in Edmonton for the day, so when Seuss and I got home, after the usual unloading and tidying (i.e corralling the stuff), we headed out to enjoy a short walk before dinner. It is always a treat to get home after being away. The house is a peaceful little island, physical and emotional miles away from the rest of the world.

Only a few days left now until Christmas Day. I am already thinking about the upcoming New Year and what fresh starts might be waiting for Chris, the dogs, and I. Funny how the rhythm of the seasons makes itself felt. It is a bit early to come to any conclusions, but I am starting to think that 2022 will be about reconnecting. With myself, with Chris, with the dogs, and with the nature that surrounds our house.

Today's photo is from my walk tonight through a quiet snowy forest with the handsome shepherd (and his frisbee, of course!). 

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
