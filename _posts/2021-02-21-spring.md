Hi,

A very short note tonight as I am late getting to bed. However, I spent quite a bit of time last weekend and this weekend working on the next post for my permaculture project. So, if you would like something to read, head on over to the [Property Report](https://propertyreport.upnix.com/) and take a look.

Today's photo is of Seuss on our walk this afternoon, with his frisbee of course! It was quite warm and definitely spring-ish.
