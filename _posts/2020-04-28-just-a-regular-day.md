Hello!

I hope everyone is doing well and managing in this continually strange time. Hard to believe we are over two months into the covid-19 pandemic, and I have been writing these daily emails since March 21!

Today was a pretty good day all around. The weather was very nice. All the recent work with my team at work to transition to SharePoint came together nicely (you may recall my earlier bemoaning of this particular project!). Chris and I had a good permaculture class, and then we continued to work on the you-know-what. Chris and I stapled hardware cloth over the windows, and then Chris did battle with the staple gun to do the same over the vents near the roof, while I installed some latches on the windows, and hinges on the front section and chicken door. We might be able to make some more progress tomorrow, but we also have fire practice, so we'll see. Luckily the chickens did ok last night in their new setup, so I think we have now set our sights on the weekend for coop completion.

Today's photo is of our eggs from today. These are eggs number 4 and 5 since the chickens arrived. It will probably help when they have a more welcoming nest box to lay them in!

Hugs,
Hannah
