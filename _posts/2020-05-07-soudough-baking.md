Hi,

Today was a good day for me, but maybe not so much for Chris. He was good enough to volunteer to take the car in to get the summer tires put on. Normally something we could do, but not this time as we bought new tires and they weren't on the rims yet. Not only did he have to wander around Canadian Tire while they swapped the tires since the waiting room by the mechanic section was closed, but through some unfortunate miscommunication they put the new summer tires on the winter rims, even though we had brought the summer set! So, he had to wait even longer until later in the day so they could swap them over. The appointment was for 9am and he only get home at 4pm. Needless to say, he earned a lot of karma today!

After Chris left this morning before work, I made my first recipe with my sourdough starter! Thanks to Lea's suggestion, I checked out the [Boreal Gourmet's sourdough starter bootcamp](https://www.borealgourmet.com/post/sourdough-bootcamp). I loved this as it explains the daily steps for starting your sourdough starter, but it also gives you things to bake along the way, depending on how "ready" your starter is! Even though my starter is currently on day 6, this morning I baked the buttermilk scones recommended for day 4 as they looked so tasty. They turned out great... so great in fact that following along with this sourdough bootcamp may require that I get started with a different kind of bootcamp!

After dinner Chris and I spent some time trying to prolong the life of our "temporary" ShelterLogic garage/storage tent. This involved using outdoor duct tape to reinforce all the areas where the cover was starting to wear through (and there were many!). It is quite windy where we have it set up, so there is quite a bit of flapping and rubbing of material, no matter how much we try to tighten it.  I think we did a good job, but I guess only time will tell if it will actually work. 

Today's photo is of the aspen, which tonight had suddenly developed a green halo that wasn't there this morning! Nature is wonderful. Life suddenly appeared when I wasn't looking.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
