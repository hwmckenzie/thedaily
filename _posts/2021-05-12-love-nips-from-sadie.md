Hi,

Sadie was feeling peppy today! She started out her morning by doing "fast dog" in the yard (running around in circles and do spins). After watching her for a bit and seeing she had no takers from Seuss and Revi to join in her play, I went out to play with her for a bit on the deck. She was so excited she nibbled my neck! Spring was definitely in the air for her as she disappeared on our walk for the first time in a long time. She arrived home about the same time as us, but by another route and carrying a beaver! I'm not sure if she did the beaver in or if she just found it, and it was a smaller beaver, but the tail was still quite impressive. I think she spent the rest of the day napping!

Today's photo is of Chris and Revi exploring some beaver activity on one of our recent walks. Revi is quite the acrobat and had no problem using the logs as her highway.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
