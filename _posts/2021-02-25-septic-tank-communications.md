I was awakened in the wee hours of the morning by our septic tank alarm. The alarm is installed to warn us when the septic tank has failed to pump out for some reason, and we are nearing capacity. The usual cause is a dip in the hose where the water pumps out, which has caused some water to pool and freeze. The alarm itself is hard to ignore, unless one sleeps with earplugs. Not having my auditory apparatuses plugged, I was alerted to the problem. While the alarm is quite loud and insistent, it is not actually as urgent as you might expect. However, once it is in my mind that the septic tank is almost full, I know I'll fret over it until the pump is operating again. It would be all too easy to forget until the worst happened! So, out I went at 2am with a bucket of hot water to see what could be done. Luckily it was a small blockage and the night was nice. After soaking the hose for a few minutes, water flow was restored and I headed back to bed, mind at ease. The dogs came out with me, but were quite happy to get back inside. Revi in particular does not like to be away from bed for long once she is settled for the night.

Today's photo is of our rooster, keeping an eye on the photographer in case she has any plans to bother the lady behind him in the grasses.
