A relaxing Saturday. We went on a good dog walk, despite the cold. We are starting to re-establish our snowshoe trails, which really helps the dogs when it is so cold as the deep snow seems to be hardest on their feet. We also brushed the snow off our solar panels (Chris) and our tent garage (Hannah). This was good as it was sunny so we captured the solar energy instead of lamenting about how we could be capturing it, if only our panels weren't covered in snow! And also, hopefully the tent garage will be less likely to fall down. Fingers crossed it will make it until spring. We also did a bit of repair in the chicken coop as one of the hooks holding up the roost had broken. Thankfully the ramp to the window shelf kept the roost from falling to the ground, otherwise we might have had some injured chickens. We also noticed that the chicken we had inside in the fall was back to looking sad, so she is back in the house with us under observation. Dr. Seuss is her attending physician. We finished off the day with some homemade pizza for dinner. Apparently I am a bit rusty, as the dough was a bit bland and the pizza stuck to the pans. Grrrrr!!! But the homemade soft mozzarella was actually pretty good!

Today's photo is of Seuss looking handsome on our walk this afternoon. I was kneeling down to take a series of photos as he ran towards me. A few seconds after this was taken he arrived and in the excitement we both fell over in the snow.

Hugs,<br />
