Hi,

A quick post tonight, as I almost forgot to write! Why are good habits so hard to keep? So, the rest of the sheep recovery story will have to wait until tomorrow. But, they were all doing well today when I checked on them with no apparent ill effects after their adventure yesterday.

Today's photo is from one of our recent morning walks. The moon is very full at the moment and quite bright. This photo shows it going down as we are getting up.

Hugs,
Hannah
