Hello,

I have been leaving the house to go to work for a few weeks now instead of working from home, and I definitely feel that I have less time in the evening to do fun things. Hmph! The key is to minimize the time and effort that goes into cooking dinner, and to avoid the sleepiness that threatens to prevent anything from happening after dinner!

Tonight Chris and I drove to where the green frisbee is lost and flew his drone again. No luck! When we got home, I took Seuss to where his orange frisbee is lost, and after much crashing around in the bushes and wading through tall grass, we found it! After telling Seuss how smart he is, I decided to try to ride the wave of success so I drove him back to where the green frisbee was lost and we wandered around for a bit, doing our best to avoid trampling the young wheat. Still no luck. That one might have to wait until the wheat is harvested and hopefully it will just be left on the ground. We did find a frisbee in a canola field after the harvest last year, so it is possible! The current count of frisbees "in the wild" is three. I think these frisbees might be Seuss's equivalent of burying gold in the backyard!

Today's photo is of some trilliums that we came across while out searching for frisbees. These grow in one spot on our property every year. I would love to have some of them in some shade near our house, but I'm not sure if they would transplant well or not.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
