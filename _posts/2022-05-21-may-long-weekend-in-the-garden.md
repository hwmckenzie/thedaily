The May long weekend is here and it is time to get the baby chicks out of our kitchen, open the greenhouse, and start up the polyculture. I have a short window to accomplish all of this between watercraft inspector training and when the stations open for the season. And if I manage to get through those things, there are a few other odds and ends I'd like to get to including replanting some strawberries and planting some pretty flowers. A small wrench developed in my plans as I ended up with a cold, but after resting on Thursday and Friday, and going slowly today, I think I'll still be able to do a few things.

I began by moving the baby chicks to the Chick-frame. One of them started crowing while I was away, so I think it is time for them to move out of the house! Not to mention that Chris and I have had enough of the dust and the smells. They were very excited to explore and spent their afternoon scratching for bugs and eating fresh grass shoots. Once the house was bird-free, I set up the greenhouse. After a few years I have it down to an art and it went up quite quickly this year, including all the extras I added last year for stabilization so as to avoid catastrophe and disappointment on the first windy day. Chris picked up the plants Lemonee started for me yesterday and I moved them out of the house as well. They are now in their pots in the greenhouse all ready to be planted tomorrow. I'm also hoping the get the polyculture started in the solarium tomorrow, although that involves moving dirt around so we'll have to wait and see if I feel up to it.

I think all that is quite enough for this summer, but I have noticed that the grass is already starting to grow and the usual panic and sense of the yard closing in around me is on the horizon. If only we had a few sheep to keep the grass in check...

Today's photo is of the baby chicks exploring their new digs (the Chick-frame). They really enjoyed their afternoon, and already two have climbed into the coop. Hopefully they realize I put their heating pad under some straw in there and they will snuggle down and be nice and toasty tonight.

Hugs,<br />
