We are back in the chicken doctoring business. Nothing too serious this time, we hope. One of our delawares has a very sad bare butt. We finally brought her in tonight and submerged her in the kitchen sink. I did disinfect it afterwards with bleach! After a soak with epsom salts, a dry, and a generous spritz with an iodine based solution, she is back in the coop. Hopefully after a few days of this regime she will start to improve. Luckily I think she is the only bare butt in our flock at the moment.

A quick update on the broody hen. She continues to brood, but she is down to one egg. I'm not sure where the three leghorn eggs went, but we removed the big brown egg yesterday. We candled it, and it did look like something started but did not develop. The remaining brown egg was very dark, which might mean it is full of a chicken, so we popped that one back under her. If it is going to hatch, it must be soon!

It has been very windy here lately, and still quite dry. Although our snow melted much earlier this year, we are well behind where we were this time last year in terms of grass growth and the trees leafing out. It is so brown, I am longing for the green to arrive. So are the sheep. They are almost done the last of their hay, so we'll have to move them soon to a new area wherever we can find the most grass.

Today's photo is of the Chickshaw progress. The siding will look much better once we get it washed off. It looks pretty good overall considering it has been laying in partly opened boxes beside one of the sheds for who-knows-how-long! It is so close to being completed! Marlene is coming out to the property tomorrow afternoon. We were planning to put up the greenhouse, but strong winds are forecast, so we may work on the Chickshaw instead.
