Hello,

I must begin with a correction. The flowers featured in yesterday's photo were not trilliums, but in fact bunchberries! At least two of my discerning readers caught this misidentification. And once it was pointed out, I thought to myself, "I knew that!". Why I have trouble remembering plant names, I'm not sure, but I find myself looking up the same plants each year. This year I have taken a lot of photos of the plants as they flower, so perhaps I will include those with names in a blog post which I can reference in the future.

After work tonight Chris and I did a tidying "power hour". Following much delay, work on installing our solar panels starts tomorrow! So of course we had to clean up in the basement as they will be accessing our electrical panel, as well as outside since the panels are going on the roof. If all goes well, installation should be completed on Tuesday, although I don't think we can turn our system on until it is inspected, so I'm not exactly sure when we'll be actually generating power. In any case both the house and the yard are looking quite good! I'm not sure how the chickens and dogs will manage tomorrow as we are going to keep them in their pen and the house respectively so they don't get under foot. I expect both species will have some complaints about this limitation on their otherwise footloose and free lifestyle!

Today's photo is of our roof before the solar system. Who knows what it will look like this time tomorrow!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
