Chris and I are enjoying a visit to the island at the moment, but I thought I would give an update on the status of the garden when we left. It is a bit rambling, just like a walk through the garden!

Our edible plants are closest to the house in the solarium, greenhouse, deck boxes and a new "three sisters" bed. Things are growing well in the greenhouse with the tomatoes, peppers and eggplants started by Lemonee looking bigger each day, and the cucumbers and nasturtians I planted from seed coming up nicely. So far the white clover I planted to act as a cover crop to improve the soil, outcompete weeds and act as a living mulch has not done much. I did see some tiny little clovers before I left, but it is not the lush carpet I imagined. Perhaps it is too hot in the greenhouse for it, or maybe it would have benefited from being planted earlier to get a leg up. In any case, it looks like I will be weeding in there this season. I also notice a difference in how fast the soil dries out without the layer of straw I used last year. Across the path is the solarium. Things are certainly coming up, but what is what and who is who remains mostly a mystery. This is one disadvantage of the polyculture method, if like me you don't know how to recognize different vegetables when they are seedlings. I also notice that I am not very good as broadcasting seed evenly, with some areas needing thinning while others are bare. I replanted my sugar snap peas and broadbeans before we left as not many germinated. Although it has gotten a slow start, I expect lots will change in the solarium while we are away and I will come back to the beginnings of a jungle. The deck boxes are enjoying their first real summer after sitting half finished for several years. I have herbs in one which I bought as seedlings through a school fundraiser, and strawberries from Marlene in the other. I don't expect too much from the strawberries this year as I transplanted them in the spring after they spent last fall being dug up by dogs. The fact that they survived the winter is already a success! The last edible area is out the kitchen window. I planted corn, squash, zuchini and beans from seed in an effort to create the three sisters. So far there is not much to report on this bed. 

The non-edible plants include some holly hock seeds I planted under our front window which came from PEI (coming up, but quite small) and the boxes and shrubs along the path to the office shed. Now that Chris is working from our basement, there is not much traffic along the path, so less chance to admire the plants and the boxes are looking a little neglected. What does best here is really any kind of sedum. This is also where our crocuses are, which makes me wonder if other bulbs would do well here and provide some early spring color. Something to try next spring. Our nanking cherries had lots of flowers this year, but I suspect they are still to young for fruit. The haskaps look quite good (execpt for one which seems to have been knocked over by a large animal!). Hopefully we will get home in time to harvest the berries before the waxwings do! There is also some rhubard growing away surrounded by a sea of grass. I'll have to rescue that!

The trees in the shield are coming along, though slower than we wish. I haven't had a chance to get down there to measure the heights, which usually reminds me of how small everything was when it started out and makes me feel better about the growth. We got to enjoy the big lilac by our house this year and the blooms were quite beautiful and pungent. The caragana was just coming into bloom as we left. Though not always my favourite, it is certainly important for the bees, evidenced by the fact that it is abuzz with activity.

Alberta is currently enjoying a "million dollar rain", so hopefully it benefits my garden as much as the surrounding crop fields.

Today's photo is of Sue testing out his new cathouse. When we left he had not slept in it overnight yet, preferring insead to prowl around on the deck at 2 am when he was ready to come in after his nightly adventures, which caused the dogs to bark, thus awakening me to let him to inside to sleep in his crate (for safey from anhy unsupervised dogs with bad ideas!). He did spend a large amount of time in the cathouse on our last day at home to escape the rain, so we're hoping he'll find it a warm and safe place while we are gone. Fingers crossed he is happy with the food our friend is leaving for him when he visits our chickens and Sue is still there when we get home.

Hugs,<br />
