Hi,

Today's update contains some highs and lows... which I guess is really just a normal day!

To start, the highs. I experienced joy this morning as I watched the dogs play rambunctiously in the yard, while the chicken door was open (and the chickens safely confined to their area) and the sheep enjoyed eating hay from their bale (also safe in their area). The best part was that I could leave the dogs out there while I went to make the coffee! I think they are happy about this return to yard supremacy. I then enjoyed working from home while watching big puffy snowflakes drift to the ground. The chicken coop continues to perform well, though we are having some problems with humidity. It is just so humid outside at the moment (mid-90%s) that the only way to get the humidity down is to turn up the heater, which we did try with some success today.

Now to the lows. The yard bliss only lasted until after lunch, when Chris pointed out that one of the Delawares had made it outside her area. Flew over the fence I guess. Apparently her flock-mates did not tell her the tale of BB. Darn chickens! Also, a few days ago we discovered that our chickens have mites, or lice, or both. We are working ourselves up to treating them, but so far have not got up the energy for it. They are also suffering from frostbite on their combs, due to the high humidity I think. I suppose those are all the lows really. Though the chicken creepy crawlies are a big one that is weighing on us. Taking care of so many animals is a bit of a challenge!

Today's photo is of my DIY sheep round bale feeder. So far it seems to be sheep approved, and sure beats peeling off hay and taking it to them each day. Plus now I don't have to worry if they are getting enough or not. I think I'll have to cut a few larger holes once they eat it down a bit, but they seem to be managing for now. Hopefully we can push it a bit further into their area so they don't have to be right by the fence to eat. And I need to retarp it. But so far a success.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
