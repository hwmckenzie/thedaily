Unlike my friends and family in the east, we are enjoying a bit a of a spring here. A false one to be sure, but still! A very mild day today, so we decided to give the coop a good clean. After testing out the poop board for a month or so, we have reverted back to the hammock. Otherwise we made no changes, so I think that means our winter coop is a well-oiled machine! The hens have continued with their egg laying renaissance, so everyone is happy!

There was a bit of unrest in our wild birds in the last few days though. On Friday Chris noticed a bird relentlessly chasing one of the chickadees. At first he thought it might be a woodpecker or blue jay, but they are around all the time and never chase the smaller birds. I noticed the blue jays were around and making a lot of noise. I suspect it was a merlin hunting for a meal. I have not see it back today, and there are quite a few birds around, so hopefully it has moved on. We have an abundance of blue jays around this year and I like having them. I think they give some protection to the smaller birds and would gang up to chase off the merlin.

Today's photo is of Chris working hard while cleaning the chicken coop. Even though the chicken door was open and it was very nice out in the solarium, the chickens all stayed inside to watch him. Maybe they want to make sure he doesn't cut any corners?
