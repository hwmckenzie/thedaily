Hi,

Well, despite my proclamations last fall that I would under no circumstances be building anything else for the chickens, tonight I started a new construction project. But this one is going to be small and very functional! It is a [Chicksaw](https://abundantpermaculture.com/mobile-chicken-coop/)! I am building the "Mini Me" edition, which is 4'x4'x2' and suitable for up to 16 chickens. We have realized that unless we want the area around the winter coop to turn into a desert, we need to move the chickens around the yard. And since our first "mobile" coop is more of a stationary beast, I was on the lookout for a lighter design. The Mini Me Chicksaw claims that it can be moved with just one person! So, the loose plan is to house the chickens in the Chicksaw when it is warm enough, and use our electronet to create new areas for them to forage frequently enough that they don't kill off all the vegetation in any one spot. Tonight I built the base and if all goes well tomorrow I can continue to progress after a quick trip to the hardware store at lunch. Luckily we have most of the materials, so hopefully it won't be too much of a drain on the chicken's bank account.

In other animal news, the sheep stayed put in their new electrowire fence, and Sad Chicken is looking much less sad. She even did a bit of scratching, pecking, and grooming today. The chicks continue to grow and are starting to look much more like chickens than fluff balls.

Today's photo is of Chris spending a bit of time with the chicks before, and Seuss watching on from outside.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
