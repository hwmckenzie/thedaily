Hi there,

The warm winds of spring blew all day today, and we flipped across the 0 degree temperature axis, all the way up to +3C! Our deck is almost snow-free!

Seuss also got some exciting news today. Over the last year or so we have been working to train the Alberta mussel-sniffing dogs to also sniff out feral pig scat, in the hopes that we can assist Alberta Agriculture with management of this destructive invasive species. Last June Seuss and I had the chance to deploy in a nearby county to try to confirm that feral pigs were the cause of some damage to a crop field. We searched the area and he did find and alert to a scat, which I was pretty confident at the time was feral pig. But, since they will eat anything that fits in their mouths, their scat can be quite variable, which makes it challenging to identify definitively in the field (Seuss points out that if you have a nose, it is actually quite easy to know who's scat it is!). This was Seuss's first "natural" find (i.e. direct from the pig instead of being put out by humans for him to practice finding.... we are a strange bunch!). We had the chance to submit the scat to a genetics lab as part of some other work later in the summer, and the results came back today. Feral pig! Seuss points out that he knew it all along, so it is old news for him.

Today's photo is (finally) of Tammi! She has eluded the camera for a few days, but today she graced me with several great shots to choose from. Here she is on our morning walk, which is her favorite time of day, followed closely by the afternoon walk, breakfast, dinner, snuggles with Chris, and nap time... which pretty much covers all her most loved activities. Note that other regular occurrences including tooth-brushing and being barked at by Seuss don't make the list! Into each life some rain must fall :)

Hugs,
Hannah
