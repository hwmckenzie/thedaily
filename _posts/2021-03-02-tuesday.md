Hi,

We had a much more normal day today. So much so that I am having trouble coming up with something to write, as the title suggests. So, I guess I'll just share the photo and then go brush Sadie's teeth, and then mine!

Today's photo is of the sheep watching the dogs and I as we returned from our walk tonight. As you can see they are almost done their second round bale. This summer I am going to build them a manger. It was very convenient not to have to take them hay every day, but I suspect they wasted more having the bale in their pen all the time. As Chris says, it would be weird knowing that your food for the next few months was all sitting there in front of you!

Hug,<br />
Hannah
