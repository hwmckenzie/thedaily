Hi,

Another short and sweet email tonight. Seuss and I (mostly Seuss) worked hard today on the film set. We had a great day and Seuss even got to find some "straight from the pig" wild boar scat!

Today's photo is of me in front of the camera. My supervisor usually does all the talking, but today she suggested that I take some of the questions. Yikes! Thanks to my coworker Heather for capturing the moment. I guess we'll see if I make the final cut.

Hugs,
Hannah
