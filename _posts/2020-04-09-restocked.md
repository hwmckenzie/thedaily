Hello!

This morning after our dog walk, Chris and I ventured into Vegreville to get groceries. On the way, we decided that we will try to make this our last grocery shop until May. It was a different picture than last time I was there. More people wearing masks, arrows taped on the floor indicating movement directions, and lots of protection for the cashiers in the form of gloves and barriers. I'm not sure who decided on the layout of the directional arrows, but suffice it to say that even I, Miss Rule Follower, did not follow them. I'm convinced that if you strictly followed the arrows, you would have ended up in a tiny space in the far back corner of the store, with no approved way out! On our travels we also stopped at the post office and the liquor store, so we can confirm that all of our favourite people are still healthy, though they are all looking a little frazzled due to the higher workload associated with increased cleaning requirements. The lady at the liquor store in particular said she had to watch much more closely what people touched but did not buy, as she had to go behind them and wipe down the bottles afterwards... Of course I immediately had a horrible realization that I had no idea if I had touched any bottles I wasn't planning on buying! Was I one of those people??? With the car full of groceries and beverages, we retreated to our little cabin to settle in for the next few weeks. Upon our return we were greeted by the dogs, whose days revolve around walks and meals, and the activities of squirrels. Perhaps we can learn something from them!

Today's photo is of last night's moon as it rose behind our sheds. The photo doesn't come close to doing it justice. However, I am authorized to let you know that the photos have the potential to get more exciting! Chris is starting to talk about letting me cut his hair. His hair was quite long before the pandemic began and he reports it is now obscuring his vision. I have suggested he own his covid hair, but so far he resists. He has located some helpful barbers who have posted videos on YouTube in hopes of assisting those untrained in hair styling. It seems that Chris might be approaching a point where me and one of those videos might be an acceptable solution for taming his problematic hair volume!

Happy Easter!
Hannah
