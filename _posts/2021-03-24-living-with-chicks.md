Hi,

Well, its been quite an exciting few days here! As many of you know from following the live feed, five chicks hatched and are now settled in their brooder in our living room. All are doing well, even the chick that arrived last and needed a bit of assistance to get out of its egg. We were a bit worried about this little chick at first. Once we got it dried off and in with the others, it was getting picked on quite a bit. The challenge of arriving after everyone else and being so much smaller I guess. However, it seems to have been accepted into the flock now and is eating and drinking and looking a whole lot happier. 

They are very entertaining to watch. Instead of using a heat lamp, we built them a "mama heating pad". I used some old fencing to create a little dome, over which we draped a heating pad, and then covered this with a towel. It is only about 4" tall, and the towel hangs over the door. It looks quite cosy! The chicks can go in an out from under the "mama hen" whenever they want as they learn to regulate their body temperatures. The pros are a reduced fire risk as compared to a heat lamp, as well as a bit of a more natural feeling for them as they can snuggle under something. A benefit for us is that because there is no additional light, the chicks go to bed when it gets dark and so far have been sleeping through the night. This is good as they are actually quite vocal and chirp away all day, in addition to scurrying around their brooder, and jumping on and off the top of their mama heating pad cave.

The dogs find the chicks fascinating. Seuss and Revi spend hours staring into the brooder and listening to all the noises the chicks make. So far everyone has been very well-behaved, with only a few reminders to "be easy" and sometimes a "too much!".

Revi also wanted me to tell everyone that on Sunday morning she found a porcupine, and displayed great sense and self-control! She barked, but did not bite it, and came when Chris called her. We were quite happy not to have a dog full of quills before 9am in the morning, and I expect our vet was as well!

Today's photo is of two of the chicks enjoying a nap in the sunshine on top of their mama heating pad cave.

Hugs,<br />
