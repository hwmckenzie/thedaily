Hi,

I decided to write my post a little earlier tonight. I have not been feeling well (I suspect a spring cold), and have fizzled the last two nights before I sat down to write! Since we are in covid times, and I had to withdraw from some work travel due to my cold, yesterday I diligently headed to Vegreville for a covid test. I can report that the nasal swab feels as peculiar as you would expect. So, now I wait to find out the results. Luckily for me my self-isolation at home includes lots of open and empty space and the company of many animals of different kinds!

The chickens get to be the stars of today's post. Later tonight Chris and I will put the eggs into "lockdown" and start waiting for the hatch! I think we are still a few days away though. There is a small hiccup as ATCO notified us they would be shutting off the power for 2 hours tomorrow morning. As we have no helpful broody hen to recruit to keep the eggs warm, Chris will be connecting the incubator to a battery pack to ensure it stays warm while the power is off.

The chickens have really been enjoying our whole yard the last few days, and we noticed that they are spending time digging around in the summer coop. Over the same time period, egg production has declined a bit. It finally occurred to me today that we should check the nest boxes in the summer coop! Lo and behold there were five eggs in there! Sneaky chickens! I have to admit, the nest boxes in the summer coop are far nicer than the ones in the winter coop, both for the layer and the collector. We have lots of ideas for improvements for both coops now that we have almost had chickens for one full year.

Today's photo is of Chris risking a traverse through a puddle of unknown depths with very thin ice on top. There were several tense moments, but he emerged still dry, though he did have to abort the crossing partway through. Sadie is helpfully demonstrating how by being smaller and having four legs she is able to cross easily.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
