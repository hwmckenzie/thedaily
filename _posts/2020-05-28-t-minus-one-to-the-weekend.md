Hello!

Well, another week is almost over. I am looking forward to my weekend, particularly since this will be my last weekend off this summer. With the very late start to the boat inspection season I have had a bunch of bonus weekends. Next Saturday one of the stations Seuss and I work at is opening, so weekends will soon find us checking boats instead of digging in the garden. However, calling Saturday and Sunday the weekend is really just a formality for us. I'll still have days off, and since Chris is in charge of his schedule, we can make our own weekends! Very lucky! ... The dogs are confused by our fixation on weekends. They are lucky dogs as we are often around to hang out with them.

We took it easy this evening, but hope to move some projects ahead over the next few days. I was planning to do the greenhouse tour tonight, but Chris and I decided to go for a drive to investigate some smoke instead. We found the field that was burning, and while it looked like they were just doing some controlled burns, it didn't look too under control to us! Luckily we know some people we can call now to ask about such things, so we talked to one of the fire chiefs and he assured us the person had a permit and he and his son had been out to look at it earlier. So, no excitement. We weren't the only ones concerned. Stephanie (our across the road neighbor with four dalmatians) texted to ask if we thought it was normal. I guess her husband Guillaume had also driven over to take a look. Nice to realize that we have been here long enough that we are part of the community information tree, and we are one of the branches that knows something!

Today's photo is of one of our bird box tenants. Tree swallows are our most popular renters, though this year one of our boxes has a chickadee pair. We are very excited about that and really hope they are successful.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
