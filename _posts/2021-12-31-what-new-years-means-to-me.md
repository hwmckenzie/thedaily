A quiet night to ring in the New Year for us. In fact, I expect when the New Year arrives there will be two humans, three dogs, and six chickens all tucked up in their beds, sleeping peacefully. I used to feel that it was important to stay up until midnight, but I've let go of that idea. For me, the more important parts of the year turning over don't happen at midnight, but the day before and on New Year's day. There is something very satisfying in closing out one year, and in starting a new one. Today I enjoyed a final yoga practice, a last evening dog walk, said goodnight to the birds at dusk, and later will snuggle up into bed with Chris, all the extra cheese and crackers I enjoyed with dinner to be left in 2021! Then tomorrow, a whole new year. Everything fresh and clean and untouched. A chance to do some things differently and to keep some the same. It feels natural to wax philosophical about New Year's, but I suppose that in fact each new day could be approached in the same way.

Today's photo is from our last dog walk of 2021. Minus 28Â°C, but beautiful!

Hugs,<br />
