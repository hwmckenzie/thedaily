With the clocks turning back, winter routines are starting to reassert themselves. As of tonight, Chris and I will start going to bed at 9pm and getting up at 6am instead of our summer hours of 10pm and 7am. While I do wish we could stop turning back the clocks and just live year round in Mountain Standard Time, "falling back" does ease the transition from summer to winter hours, somewhat. It is almost like we can pull the wool over our own eyes and convince ourselves that 6am is just the new 7am. Sadly this technique has reduced effectiveness after about day two! 

The dogs and I also restarted another winter routine today, the afternoon walk. This is a very popular activity with the dogs (for obvious reasons!) and also with us as tired dogs are less expectant dogs, and this leads to a more relaxed house. We started today's walk by heading up the hill. It quickly became apparent that we didn't do this route very often over the summer. Seuss and Revi raced up and down the hill several times while Sadie and I huffed and puffed our way up. Sadie's excuse is that she is almost 65 years old in dog years. I don't really have an excuse. I am always a bit disheartened to realize that while all the yoga I do is very good for me, it doesn't translate into hill-climbing prowess! Chris seems to have natural, self-maintaining hill-climbing strength. Quite annoying!

Today's photo is of the dogs enjoying my birthday bench at the top of the hill (after the photographer had recovered her breath!).

Hugs,<br />
