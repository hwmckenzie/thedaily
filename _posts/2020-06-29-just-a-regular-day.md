Hello,

As I sit here, staring at a blank page and wondering what to write about today, I begin to realize that work days are much less exciting than non-work days! It isn't that they aren't interesting and rewarding, it is just that they are all very similar and don't provide as much fodder for entertaining anecdotes. Luckily tomorrow is a non-work day, so everyone can look forward to that!

This morning we walked down a new road and came across some cows. Most were quite far off, but one was right by the fence along the road. Revi got quite excited about this, and given what I know about her, as well as her history with cows, we quickly restrained her with Chris's belt. This is not my normal procedure, but I had forgotten both the leash and ecollar remote at home (of course!), and we didn't want any cow-chasing incidents. Chris tried to go up to say hi to the cow, but it was skittish and ran off in search of its friends before he could get very close. Sadie was excited about the cow too, but decided to roll in its poop instead of chasing it. This earned her a cold face wash with soap upon returning home and before breakfast! Our close bovine encounter got us thinking that it might be nice to have a milk cow. Not only would we get fresh milk, but it could help with our grass glut.

Today's photo is of the progress on our solar panel installation. It doesn't look like much yet.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
