Hello!

It is a "Friday" for me, so Chris and I are looking forward to a one-day weekend tomorrow. The weather looks good so hopefully we can continue to make progress on our vegetable garden boxes. We peeked in on the garden boxes we set up in the dog run a few weeks ago and there are some things starting to sprout! I am looking forward to a closer look tomorrow.

The other activity in the plan for tomorrow is to bath poor Seuss, who has been stricken with itchiness. He has struggled with being very itchy for a while and I've tried various things without much success. Today I got some medicated shampoo, so I'm going to try that. Fingers crossed it helps as he seems pretty uncomfortable. Tammi is also on the bath roster as she has been spending time in the swamp, and smells like it!

Today's photo is of the visitor who passed outside our kitchen window this evening. Quite an impressive animal, and not one I'd want to meet while on our morning walk. We'll have to redouble our noise-making efforts tomorrow morning, or perhaps just walk somewhere else!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
