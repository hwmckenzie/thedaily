Everyone got back into their normal routines after our return from California. Sadie and Riblet have developed a strong friendship based on various wrestling games. Everyday they play the standing up bite-face game, the leg-bite game, the rear-like-horses game, the wait-and-charge-and-pounce game, and when they get tired, the laying down bite-face game. It is really cute to watch and it warms my heart to think that miss senior Sadie has made a friend who brings out her inner puppy. The past week was still quite wintery, but showing signs of warming up. There is much more snow this year than last, so we are looking forward to a good spring melt and hopefully a full dugout. The chickens continue to enjoy their solarium, and we had our first day of 100% laying success in quite a while over the weekend! Before I left, I dropped off some seeds and supplies to Lemonee and she will be starting some seeds for me while I am away for this year's garden. I have plans to turn the chicken solarium into the summer greenhouse and try to plant a polyculture (where many vegetables grow intermingled, apparently to everyone's benefit!) in the old greenhouse boxes. I'm sure I'll provide updates on any success or "learnings" once the planting starts. Chris has arranged for our house to undergo an energy audit, which will happen tomorrow. I'm quite interested to get the results and share any highlights, including any recommendations for upgrades.

I am on the move again after a week at home, this time acting as Seuss's roadie on his trip across (part of) America. After stopping in Blairmore to pick up Heather and Diesel, we crossed the border into Montana this morning and made our way to Dillon, MT for the night. Not much snow south of the border and lots of beautiful moutain foothill views. Our end destination is Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, where we will be taking a recertification test to make sure our mussel detection skills are up to snuff. However, we have a few stops along the way. Tomorrow we are heading to Salt Lake City, UT, where we are doing some preparatory work for a potential new project focusing on New Zealand mudsnails. 

Today's photo is of Riblet and Sadie demonstrating the laying down bite-face game!

ps: Happy Pie Day! (Thanks to Heather, we each had a personal-sized pie for dessert tonight!)

Hugs,<br />
