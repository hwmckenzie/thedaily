Hi,

Happy Thanksgiving! I'm not sure that I have any more things to be thankful for this year than in any other year, but they are more forefront in my mind this year for sure. I made our turkey thighs in the instant pot and they were very tasty. As was the pumpkin pie (not made in the instant pot, but I bet you could!). It was my best pumpkin pie ever, and also the most butter I ever used in a crust. Coincidence? I think not!

I had a busy day and continued to make progress on the coop, despite the gusty wind which threatened to blow me and the coop away. The pressure is on and the worry is here as it is forecast to go below zero every night this week, and on Thursday it will stay in the negative even during the day. I think I will take a short break from coop construction tomorrow morning to try to do a bit of insulating and winterizing of the summer coop, just to make the birds a bit more comfortable in the short term. Barring that I suppose we could always set them up in our bathroom...

The dogs are all doing well, except Revi who is limping. This is either due to an overextension on our walk or while playing with Seuss. Our main yard area where they play has a lot of holes (dug by the dogs of course!), where, speaking from experience, humans or canines can easily turn an ankle. Hopefully she is feeling better tomorrow or she will have to miss the walk. A great injustice for Revi, whose legs turn on when she gets up in the morning and don't stop until she goes to bed!

Today's photo is of the coop progress. It is coming, but there are so many unanswered questions. Such as, how to install the window, how to build a door, the plan for the roof, how to make it so we can plug it into an extension cord... I could go on, but I might have a panic attack. I just have to take it one step at a time.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
