Hello!

This morning's walk was about losing things. We had just gotten to the point on our walk furthest from the house when Revi and Seuss decided that once they went over the rise, they would continue on. Ignorant of their plans, I stood for a little bit on our side of the rise, until I realized they weren't coming back. Upon consulting the Tractive, Rotten Revi was located over a quarter section away, and  Seuss-on-the-Loose was not reporting in with his location... though we suspected they were together. Given how much ground they can cover when they want to, they must find our pace agonizingly slow! The dogs travel the same distance in about 5 minutes as we do over the course of our whole 45 minute walk. So, we (temporarily!) lost Revi and Seuss, and Seuss of course lost his green frisbee, which I would like to add I had just presented him with this morning... after he lost his orange one last week! With the losses accumulating, we made a quick beeline for the house with poor Sadie trailing in our wake, no doubt wondering why her morning walk had taken such a turn! Part of the way back, Seuss-on-the-Loose finally checked in, but was mysteriously at the end of our driveway and not moving... As we got closer and it was apparent that Seuss was not waiting for us at the end of our driveway, the penny dropped and we realized that he must have also lost his Tractive! Luckily (miraculously?!), when we reached the house we were greeted by both Revi and Seuss. As always, when I see them after they have "gone walkabout", I am never more grateful for anything in my life than the sight of their furry faces! So, we are currently down one frisbee and one Tractive. I think the frisbee should be easy to find, but the Tractive may prove more difficult. We know approximately where it is, but our search efforts are hindered by the vegetation, its small size, dark color, and the hordes of bloodthirsty mosquitoes. With the last impediment being the greatest.

Today's photo is of Seuss getting a bath. I am currently trying to bath him once a week with some special shampoo in an effort to curb his itching. This was week two. Chris provides entertainment by delivering treats under the sliding shower door while I lather and rinse. I am not wearing any pants!

Hugs,<br />
