Not too much to report from the property today. I went to Vermilion to do a few Christmas related errands. My conclusion is that while I want to support local businesses, it seems like all the things they want to sell me are just more stuff. Stuff I don't want cluttering up my house. Stuff that gets in the way of what really matters. And I've decided it is also stuff that my friends and family don't want or need either! I've found some really great gifts for people this year. Things I think they'll really love. And otherwise I am giving them the gift of Nothing!

Today's photo isn't great quality, but I felt it was too funny not to share. Chris and I came across it while looking through our trail camera cards. You may recall the photo I posted a few days ago of the dogs out for their walk? Well, now you can see the photographer in action!

Hugs,<br />
