Hi,

Quite the day here at the property! We woke up at 5:30, just after the first chick hatched. Then we spent the morning wringing our hands with worry that it wouldn't have any other chicks to grow up with. Our fears were alleviated with the arrival of three more chicks throughout the afternoon. So much peeping! Things have slowed down now. There is one more egg that looks to be starting to hatch, but it hasn't progressed in a while. No signs of life from the other two. We did have two questionable eggs after our last candling, so not a complete surprise. I am still holding out hope that the one who has started will make it out by tomorrow morning. The current chicks are quite feisty at times, climbing all over each other, and clearly eager to get out of the incubator and get on with life. We are supposed to wait to make sure they all get a chance to dry off, and our chicken mentor has just texted to say we could move them to the brooder tomorrow at about 10 am. The chicks were very appreciative of everyone in the audience rooting for them today. Hatching is hard work! 

Since you have probably all watched the chicks at some point today, I decided to go with a non-chick photo. As mentioned yesterday, here is the same shot from my first post on March 21, 2020, but taken today, shown side-by-side with the original. We are certainly experiencing an earlier spring this year. 

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
