Hello!

The chicken coop construction continues! I had no idea I would be writing so many updates about how we were still working on the coop. It is a good thing we don't have a definitive chicken pick-up date yet, as their cosy home is not quite ready. It is looking like we might get them this weekend though, so the pressure to get the coop done is increasing.

We have completed most of the framing for the coop proper and the run, and have installed the floor for the main coop and the laying boxes. So far, construction has been occurring on our deck. One of us, I won't say who, is staring to be concerned that it may not be possible to get the coop off the deck without assistance. Considering we carried up the wood that has now gone into the coop in several trips, I don't think this concern is completely unfounded! Good thing we joined the fire department. At least we have a few friends we can call to help us lift it down if needed. Despite the potential logistical issue of getting the coop on the ground, I think constructing it on the deck was necessary to ensure it didn't end up all cock-eyed! To try to maintain quality standards, we have put the level to good use, although I am starting to suspect it is a very forgiving and optimistic level, as its definition of "level" seems to allow for quite a broad range of angles!

Chris took today's photo, which shows our progress to date. Hopefully tomorrow's will show even more progress.

Hugs,
Hannah
