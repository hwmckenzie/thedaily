Hi there,

Today's sourdough bootcamp recipe was gingerbread. It was quite good, but not as much of a crowd-pleaser as the pizza. I think I may have overdone the spices. The recipe included cloves, and reading about their flavour profile just now I see it is described as "sweet, bitter, and astringent"... I have a feeling the amount in the recipe put us solidly past "sweet" and in to the "bitter" realm. However, they are still disappearing from the pan, so I'd say while they are not destined to be a fan-favourite, they are alright! Tomorrow's recipe is fig, anise, hazelnut, and gorgonzola sourdough bread... I can tell you already, there will be substitutions for all four of those ingredients!

This evening Chris and I pulled out the pieces to a greenhouse that Marlene helped us build in 2014 during our second summer of dating. It was ingeniously designed from PVC pipe and poly. I know the design must be very clever as Chris and I were able to figure out how to put it together in under 20 minutes based on only a few photos Chris had! There are a few small pieces missing which we are hoping to replace this week, but then we can finish putting it together and it will be all ready to become a welcoming home for the plants that need hot weather. Along with the photo we found showing the structure itself, we also came across photos of our harvest from that summer. Quite impressive! Fingers crossed we can have as much success this summer.

As a final note, a quick update on the chickens. Whoever laid the first egg in the nest box yesterday must be a trend-setting chicken because today we got four more eggs, and they were all in boxes!!!

Today's photo is a screen shot of my work-in-progress map of our property that I am putting together as part of our permaculture course. The idea behind the map is to layer information about the property including your structures, fences, terrain and climate. We are also considering our work zones (numbered in the picture) and sectors (white arcs), which are things you either want to enhance or reduce. All of this information helps you to decide the best place for your elements, such as gardens and chickens. The great aerial photo that is the background to my map is one Chris took with his drone. Also important to note is that the junk pile to the northeast is not ours!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
