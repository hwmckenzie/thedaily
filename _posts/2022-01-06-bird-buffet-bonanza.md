I remain stuck at a yogurt impasse. This evening I bit the bullet and chose a yogurt culture. I went with "Mediterranean". Now, just so you have an accurate picture of what I ordered, it is about 1 tsp of white powder, which is actually freeze dried bacteria. True, it is shipping from the US, but I assumed it would fit in a letter envelope. Imagine my shock (indignation?) when the shipping estimate was $14! I couldn't bring myself to check out. However, looking on Amazon, I see less desirable product options for approximately $25, but  with free shipping (if we make additional purchases of course!). For some reason that appealed to me more, though as I recount this I can already feel myself swinging back in the direction of the smaller company, which in fact offers a product I prefer, for basically the same price all in. All that said, due to all this waffling, last night we bought yogurt.

Keeping with the dairy theme, Chris and I are going to try our hand at making mozzarella. I got a kit and we were all ready to do it tonight until we watched the instructional video. The lady made it look easy, but reading the directions and looking at the time, we decided to wait until Saturday so we didn't feel rushed. I am optimistically planning pizza for Saturday night dinner.

Today's photo is of a downy woodpecker enjoying some suet. I've been watching the birds quite a bit over the last few days. We put out the last of our birdseed over Christmas, and we were feeling badly that we didn't have any more as it has been so cold. But at the same time, we were putting off going to Vegreville because it has been so cold! What finally gave us the push to go was seeing a bird out first thing in the morning while it was still dark as we walked the dogs down the driveway. The bird must have been starving or freezing to venture out in the dark to forage. So last night we stocked up on sunflower seeds, finch feast, nuts, and suet. Chris put out all the different options last night so everything would be ready first thing this morning. The buffet guests were a bit slow to arrive, but word seemed to be spreading that the feast was back on and there were more birds by this afternoon. They sure liven up my days in the winter.
