Hi!

I guess it has been a while since I've written. Things continue to be well here. For our "Twelve Dates of Christmas" date tonight, Chris and I went skating on the dugout. We have only done this once before a few years ago, and at the time I was the only one with skates. However, Chris got skates for his birthday, so we tested them out tonight. We shoveled a very mini rink and a small loop, did some laps, heard some cracking (though I'm sure it was nothing serious!), did some more laps, and enjoyed some hot chocolate. I am quite rusty on the skates, so hopefully we get out a few more times this winter. The ice was pretty good, though definitely quite variable. One corner of the circuit in particular has to be approached with caution to avoid getting tripped up.

Today's photo is of us at the dugout rink, lit by our headlights strategically placed on the ice and Chris's phone balanced on my boot!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
