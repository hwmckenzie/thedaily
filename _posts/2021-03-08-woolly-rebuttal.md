Hi,

I don't have any first-hand stories to report from home today as Seuss and I were away all day in Edmonton. However, Chris told me that Revi tried to make friends with the sheep, and was rebutted. Poor Revi! I guess she was out with the sheep and got quite close. About one dog-distance away. She is very curious about them. Chris was watching, and so was Sadie. Sadie started to head that way, likely to stir the pot! So, Chris called back Sadie, but Revi also thought she had to come back. Well, as soon as she turned her back on the sheep, one of them tried to head butt her! She just managed to jump out of the way in time. It certainly adds more mystery to what goes on behind those suspicious sheep eyes!

Today's photo is of Chris's conflict resolution session with our rooster. After tolerating several attacks on his boots, Chris decided it was time to try picking up the rooster and carrying him around for a bit. I think the session must have gone well, as in this photo they are at the end of it and the rooster is sitting calmly on Chris's leg by choice. I guess we'll have to wait and see if his understanding of the hierarchy lasts. Chris says the rooster has very strong legs, so probably best to make sure he doesn't think he is in charge of us!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
