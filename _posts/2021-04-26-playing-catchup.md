Hi,

After a bit of a hiatus, I am back to the daily post.

I had a great birthday last Wednesday. I started the day by getting my first covid shot, and finished it off with perfect lobster rolls (made by Chris!) and cake. Then I got to enjoy some days off from work, which I spent doing things around home. Work on the Chickshaw continued, and made some big strides with the addition of the wheels, the nest boxes, the chicken ramp, and completion of the frame. The final tasks are to add the siding and roofing, the handlebars, and then the amenities including the feeder, waterer, and supplement dispensers. Hopefully by the end of this week? 

Today's photo is of yours truly blowing out her candles. Luckily there were not 40 of them!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
