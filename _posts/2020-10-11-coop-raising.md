Hi!

Happy Thanksgiving to everyone! Chris and I are eating our turkey dinner (just the thighs since it is only two of us) tomorrow, but today felt like Thanksgiving as well. Lots of things happening here over the last few days.

Yesterday we made a change in our commode situation. For those of you who may not know, when we built our place we decided to go with a composting toilet. This was partly to save water and also because our septic tank situation was a little non-traditional. We purchased a Nature's Head toilet, which was very expensive given what it was. Basically a fancy bucket with a urine diverter! We had good success with it for a few years, but recently have had several bug infestations for unknown reasons. While taking our permaculture course this summer we learned that some people just simplify and use an actual bucket. We are currently on day two of giving this a try. I built a "Lovable Loo" following the directions [here](https://humanurehandbook.com/humanure_toilet.html) and we have installed it in our bathroom on a temporary trial basis. Early results are cautiously optimistic. Stay tuned!

With Chris's assistance I also raised the walls of the winter chicken coop today! Despite being the windiest day in recent history, we leveled the coop floor and installed the walls. Quite exciting! I can really start to see it coming together and imagine our laying hens and rooster being happy there over the winter and next summer. If tomorrow is less windy I plan to house wrap the frame, start installing the siding, and hopefully figure out the geometry of the roof. So far it has been almost all leftover wood from our roof, which has been great, but is also very obvious in terms of squareness... or lack thereof! 

Today's photo is of me proudly showing off the progress to date on the winter chicken coop. For someone who struggled to make a cd holder in grade 7 this is quite the improvement... though I am still expecting to require a decent amount of spray foam insulation to address the gaps :)

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
