Hi,

Just a regular Thursday here. We dog walked (quickly!), we sat at desks, and we ate meals. Chris did his chicken chores and I did my sheep chores. I folded my body into various yoga positions. It is still cold. Chaser told us yesterday that he would not be starting, even though he was plugged in. Perhaps tomorrow we will bring in his battery and try to warm it up enough to give him the kick he needs to start. The car equivalent of a strong coffee! Apparently we are at the beginning of a warming trend, so maybe by the weekend? I think that is all the news! We are all just waiting for the temperature to rise.

Today's photo is from a while ago. It is of Sadie keeping an eye on the sheep as they approach the deck. I think they were following me back to the house just to make sure they didn't miss any oats. Hopefully when it warms up they can enjoy exploring again. The last few days they haven't strayed much further than the distance between their shed porch and the hay.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
