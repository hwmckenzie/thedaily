Hello,

We are all a little damp after a day of rain, hard at times! It was the first real rainy day of the summer. The humans wimped out from the morning walk due to blowing rain. The dogs were initially distracted from this grievous wrong done them by the early appearance of breakfast. This lulled them into their post-breakfast nap routine, but by mid-afternoon they were wide awake and definitely starting to get cabin fever. This manifests itself by all the dogs jumping up at any slight move made by a human. If you need a kleenex, or to go to the bathroom, or to get a sweater, or to make some tea, you can be assured that you will be accompanied on these short forays by highly excited dogs doing their best to convince you that a walk is in fact what you got up to do! As I write this, I know they might still jump up if I got up and went to the door, but for the most part I think they have accepted the horrible truth that there will be no walk today. It is hard disappointing the dogs as they are so optimistic, enthusiastic, and ready to go on adventures with us. Us humans will have to demonstrate more grit tomorrow morning as the forecast for tomorrow is more rain.

The rain also bred a bit of discontent with our current rain barrel setup... which was quickly overwhelmed during the periods of harder rain throughout the day. We have some plans, but haven't had a chance to implement them yet. It was hard to listen as many litres of rainwater ran off our roof, down our gutter, and out on to the ground around our house. It is supposed to be sunny this weekend, so perhaps we'll have a chance to implement some parts of our plan. At the moment it involves some loose ideas about directing rainwater from our roof into our greenhouse, through our vegetable garden boxes (which I note are still in stacked wood configuration!), along our row of willows by the deck, and then... somewhere else! One challenge will be to ensure the levels of each section are correct to capture some water and to be able to keep any overflow moving through the system without having to pump it. I see some conceptual sketches in our future! And some mud.

Today's photo is of one of our humble rain barrels, pressed into service. Hopefully in the near future this rain barrel can become part of a larger team so it doesn't have to work alone!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
