Hello,

Saturday turned out to be a very successful day!

I started by making some morning glory muffins. Well, that's what the recipe said, but it really was just a starting point as we were missing many ingredients, so substitutions were made... and they turned out like muffins! Then after much suspense, we peeked in at our yogurt, which had been completing its final set overnight in the fridge. Much improved in thickness compared to last time, and Chris says it tastes like plain yogurt, even though I swear I can still taste a bit of burrito spice. Tomorrow I will be able to enjoy it for breakfast with the "prairie granola" I also made today, which has lentils in it! I thought the lentils would be weird, but actually they crisp up really nicely and add some good texture, as well as protein.

After all the action in the kitchen I was all cooked out, so we decided to have a fire outside and cook hotdogs for dinner. The weather warmed up quite a bit and it was sunny, so really nice to have a chance to sit outside. Once they realized we were not going for a walk, but just sitting around, the "old ladies" (Tammi and Sadie) decided it was not warm enough to join us. Seuss and Revi did sit with us. Revi dividing her attention between the fire and Chris, and Seuss dividing his between the fire and his duck (featured in today's photo).

Our final accomplishment for today was completing our taxes! Made quite painless thanks to Ufile and the ability to automatically download all of our information directly from the CRA into our file. Considering they know everything about us already, it is nice to benefit from it!

As promised, Seuss features in today's photo.

Lots of hugs,
Hannah
