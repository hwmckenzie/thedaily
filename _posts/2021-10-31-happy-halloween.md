Today was another wonderful fall day. Better even than yesterday as it was not as windy. This fall has been such a treat, I am starting to be nervous about what is in store for us this winter.

Despite good progress on the winter coop, it is not quite move-in ready. I think it is safe to say that due to fact we are progressing on several fronts simultaneously, progress in any one direction is reduced. In addition to putting the finishing touches on the winter coop, we have also started cleaning the basement in anticipation of constructing an office for Chris down there. He has decided to move out of the shed over the winter due to the cost of heating it, and thanks to covid and working from home, there is a shortage of office space in our house! 

We also have an update on the light sussex. We have found her a new flock. We will be exchanging her for another leghorn hen with a lady who lives just down the road from us. We met her as I had posted some egg cartons on the Innisfree facebook group. Maybe she will be a new friend!

Today's photo is of a small pumpkin I carved to celebrate Halloween. He/she originally had two teeth, but we had a bit of a accident. 

Hugs,<br />
