Hi,

Well, my presentation went well, but I am paying the price for my late night yesterday! After dinner I wandered around the yard in a daze, checking to see what was alive, what was growing, and what was dead. I picked some dandelions for the chickens, but they weren't interested in them. I tried to get the drip irrigation going in the greenhouse, but lost steam as quickly as the hose seemed to lose pressure. Neither of us made it around to all the boxes! I expect I should just go to bed but I seem to be resisting it. Why is that?

Today's photo is of a patch of early blue violets I came across in my wanderings. I saw a few patches of these flowers. So far this year I think we've had more flowers than usual, so I am looking forward to the early June display.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
