Hello!

When I got home this afternoon, after emptying and cleaning the Seuss-mobile (a never ending task!), I took a walk around our yard to see what had changed in my absence. The most obvious change is the presence of our new rooster! He is quite handsome with his long feathers and large comb and waddle. He also has quite the voice and startled me a few times by crowing. He is very athletic and seems to keep an eye on the hens, which is why we got him. I'm not sure our original hens are truly part of his flock yet, but they seem to be warming up to him and tonight everyone is sleeping in the coop. In the vegetable department, there are quite a few ripe cherry tomatoes, and even a few large tomatoes that are starting to turn color. The garden in the dog run is mostly done and it seems we had a bit of a frost, so I'll harvest it in the next few days and report on the results. I also went down to visit the sheep. Well, actually I went down to the sheep pen and the sheep came from somewhere else in the yard to see if I had brought them any food. However, in their haste they accidentally let me in on a secret, which is that they got back into their pen by going under a section of the old fence, not over it! So, tomorrow Chris and I will try to close off that little escape route and see if that stops their walkabouts.

Today's photo is of the sheep this morning up by our house checking out the chickens. Although I think they are mostly checking out the chickens, Chris says they were also busy eating his Virginia Creeper, which we have been nursing for the last few years... In truth, Chris has been nursing it while I have to admit I have had a few accidents involving the creeper and the weed wacker. Luckily it seems to come back!

Hugs,
Hannah
