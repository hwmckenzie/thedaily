Hi,

I hope everyone is having a Christmas week that is as relaxing as us! My days involve a morning dog walk, daytime yoga, and then an evening dog walk. The rest of the minutes are divided between eating, doing a puzzle, and dog training. Quite pleasant! Although, the puzzle has the added feature of being a hologram, so I have to take breaks or I start to go cross-eyed!

We did have an extra bit of animal husbandry today. After doing his chicken chores, Chris announced that he was bringing in a Delaware with a poopy butt for cleaning. So I prepared the chicken bath, which is also our kitchen sink. As a side note, when we build our garage it will have a sink in it for such tasks! After a quick bidet, we put the chicken on a towel in our bathtub until she dried off. We just put her back outside now before we head bed and are feeling quite smart. Certainly better than having to set up a crate in the basement. We'll see how she is doing tomorrow. I saw another bidet candidate out there today, but aborted catching her as it was causing a panic in the flock and success seemed quite unlikely. I will have to get the Chicken Whisperer (a.k.a Chris) on the case tomorrow.

Today's photo is of the bathroom chicken getting settled.

Hugs,
Hannah
