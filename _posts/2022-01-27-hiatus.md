After a strong start on the trails series, I have hit a roadblock. It is the roadblock that sneaks up on you when you try to get too fancy or bite off more than you can chew. I had decided my next trails post would be about all the trails nearby our property, since if I did them one by one, it might take quite a while. I also decided I wanted to have the trail data for my map organized in a certain way, which has required a bit of trouble-shooting behind the scenes. And of course while I'm working on these things, bedtime sneaks up on me and I have to leave it for another day! When I realized I was at risk of missing my deadline again tonight, I decided to take a small break from the trails series so the Daily could keep going. But I am aiming for tomorrow! Or Saturday at the latest (which is likely more realistic as we are planning a campfire tomorrow night with smokies and smores).

So in this pause, I can share some random things from the property. First, the sprouts are doing really well! They were a bit slow to start, but the last few days they've really taken off. I've tested a few and some of them are surprisingly spicy. I'm planning to present some to the chickens this weekend and see what they think, and put some in egg salad sandwiches for Chris and I. Amazing to grow so many greens in the winter without any extra heat or light. Second, I've observed that the dogs have an uncanny sense for where old snowshoe trails are, even when they are covered by new snow. It is neat to watch them walk along on an invisible (to me) trail. That being said, today I walked beside Seuss for about 100 m as he floundered in the snow, while I traveled along atop the old packed snowshoe trail. I'm not sure if he didn't clue in, or if he was just trying to prove that he didn't need the trail! And third (because three is a nice number), yesterday I learned that Chief Chicken has a second name. He has been christened Theodore by the friend who looked after our chickens while we were away. Chris and I quite like Theodore and feel it suites him.

Today's photo is of the Manitoba maples on the south side of our house in the morning light. They look so gnarled!
