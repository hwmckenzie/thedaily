Hi,

A nice day here. It started out overcast and wet, but ended with sun. 

The main thing today was to further investigate what might be going on with our chickens. We captured the hen we think laid the soft eggs (based on her having yolk stuck to her butt). We cleaned up her butt and gave her an examination... or at least, tried to looked her over as best we could, given our very basic knowledge of chickens... with the help of Google. Nothing really stood out and she looked healthy as far as we could tell. But, just in case, after moisturizing her comb and trimming her nails, we set her up in a crate in Chris's office overnight. Hopefully she will lay a good egg tomorrow. Unfortunately when we went to put the other chickens to bed we found the hen we call "bare butt" standing with an egg cracked on the ground below her and the remnants dripping down her legs. Poor bare butt! So, it looks like we have a new candidate for examination and quarantine tomorrow. We have no idea what could be going on.

Today's photo is one of our more adventurous chickens checking out the garden by the office shed. I was over there mulching the trees and she came over to see what I was doing. It would be nice if they spent more time over there digging and scratching, but for the moment it seems like it is a bit too far from their coop for comfort.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
