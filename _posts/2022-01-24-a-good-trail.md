I think I might be in need of a project. Lately I've felt at a bit of a loss for things to write about. By now you are all familiar with our daily activities which include dog walks, working, cooking, and more dog walks! Out of interest, I took a peek back at The Daily from this day last year. Chris and I were recovering from a very rough night which saw us up at 2:45 am to add a second heater to chicken coop and put hay out for sheep as the temperature plummeted. I then went on to talk about "pre-grazing" for the sheep by pulling hay off their bale so they didn't have to work so hard to eat in the cold. Can you imagine?! I suppose I can, since I actually did it! Anyway, lacking sheep and with our renovated winter coop exceeding expectations, I am in need of something new to talk about. 

Today as I was enjoying the evening dog walk, I decided that a series of blog posts about the trails on our property might be just the motivation I need to get through the last week of January. I've been thinking about trails a lot lately as we have enough snow, and a recent ice crust, to make walking off-trail a bit closer to trudging than I like! It is particularly hard for Sadie and I don't like to watch her struggle through the deep snow. We've got some trails laid in quite well with our snowshoes, but we need to get a few more of our regular routes packed down. There is nothing better than walking on a well packed snowshoe trail! And if we get them packed down well enough, with a bit of melting and then some cold weather they even stand up to travel without snowshoes, which feels quite freeing! The other benefit of a series of blog posts about our trails is the opportunity to solidify our naming system. Chris and I have developed quite a few names for all the trails we walk around our property, but they don't always agree, which makes communicating about route finding a bit of a challenge!

Today's photo is a kick off to the Trails series! Here is to many steps with good company and on a good trail.

Hugs,<br />
