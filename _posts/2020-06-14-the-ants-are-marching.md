Hi!

Seuss and I are home after a busy two days inspecting boats. He's still got it! 

While I was away Chris investigated the ant colony which seems to have established itself in our greenhouse. I haven't had a chance to hear all the details, but initial reports suggest it is quite large and very active. He gave a spot which appeared ant-free a poke, and ended up with a hand covered in ants! We haven't had a chance yet to investigate whether they will be detrimental to our plants or not. But, we are prepared as I bought a very large bag of diatomaceous earth for just this purpose, and to sprinkle on our chickens in case they (particularly BB) are carrying around any hitchhikers!

Today's photo is of the ants on our compost barrel a few weeks ago. They must have been the early colonizers, as their numbers have increased substantially!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
