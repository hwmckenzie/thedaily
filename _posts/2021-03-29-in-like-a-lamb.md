Hi,

Today we were reminded of just how wild the weather can be. Last night we went to bed with our phones warning of a winter storm, but no real evidence or belief that it would materialize. Boy were we wrong! The wind picked up overnight, and when I got up in the wee hours of the morning, all I could see outside was white. My spidey sense began to tingle, and lo and behold, after a valiant effort and multiple blinks, the power went out. This is how we came to be boiling water at 3am on our gas stove (thank goodness) to fill a hot water bottle so our one week old chicks could snuggle under it. And also how we came to get up 90 minutes later to reheat the water to make sure they didn't get cold. It wasn't very cold outside, so we didn't have to parade the big chickens into the bathroom! Thank goodness!

Of course, just as we were falling back to sleep the radio went off and we headed out to respond to a semi rollover. Luckily the driver was ok, though complaining of back pain, and the truck was completely off the road. So all we had to do was sit in our truck and wait for the ambulance and RCMP to arrive. We did get out briefly to set up some pylons and I was shocked by the wind. I don't think I've ever experienced anything like it. I couldn't breath unless I turned my face away from the wind. Amazing!

A bit the worse for wear after a night of interrupted sleep and being out in a gale, we returned home to collect ourselves. Clearly we were not going to Calgary today as planned! While restoring our energy with some breakfast, there was the smallest of sounds and Chris looked out the front door in time to see one of our spruce trees fall. It was amazingly quiet. Luckily it fell in pretty much the only direction it could have that didn't involve squishing something. Except the lilac. That poor bush had a worst morning than we did!

We lost power once more in the afternoon, but got it back just as we were sitting down for dinner. I am certainly looking forward to going to bed tonight! Weather permitting, our trip to Calgary is tentatively scheduled for tomorrow. The one winter storm preparatory step I did take was to turn the van around so I have a straight run down the driveway and out to the road!

Today's photo is an homage to our fallen spruce. I looked at this tree every time I walked out the front door, and many times throughout the day. It was home to countless birds and squirrels, of both the flying and non-flying variety. It will be sorely missed.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
