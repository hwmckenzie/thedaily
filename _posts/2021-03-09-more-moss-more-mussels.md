Hi,

Another day of moss ball and mussel hunting for me, and more of the same tomorrow. Seuss stayed home today as all I am doing now is going around and collecting them from pet stores. I think he wishes he was coming, but if he knew it would just be a bunch of sitting in the van he would probably agree that staying home was more fun. After all, with all the nice weather there are lots of new shows on chicken and sheep TV!

Today's photo is of Revi, observing the sheep from the safety of the deck. 

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
