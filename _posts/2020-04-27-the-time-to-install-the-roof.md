is when the sun is shinning... or at least so said JFK. I would agree with him!

By this chapter of The Chicken Chronicles, I bet you can guess what Chris and I did with our evening! Tonight's success was installing the roof. Although we worked later than we planned, we got it done and as a bonus got to enjoy a rainbow and some beautiful evening light. Sadly it is still not move-in ready, but we are getting closer. I guess chickens face the same timeline challenges with home renovation as humans!

The chickens are trying a new evening accommodation setup tonight. Instead of shuttling them back to the van, we have closed them into the dog kennel, surrounded it with straw bales (for warmth and also so they don't have to look any potential predators in they eye!), and secured the door of the larger dog run that the kennel is in. So fingers crossed all those counter measures protect them overnight.

Today's photo is of Chris working on the roof under some stunning evening light. You will notice that we managed to get the coop off the deck!

Hugs,
Hannah
