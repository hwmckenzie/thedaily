Hi,

After spending most of the day in a windowless meeting room in Edmonton, I was immensely glad to get home to the property tonight. It is so peaceful and quiet here! Since I spent so much time staring at a computer today and driving, I put screens of all kinds aside tonight and sat down on the floor with Sadie. I have been trying to massage her more as she is now older and stiffer. Usually I give her a quick massage after I brush her teeth, to make up for the forced dental hygiene! Tonight we spent more time and it was very relaxing. Both of us were laying on the floor and felt very mellow by the end! It is the first time I have really slowed down enough to just be with her in quite a while. I am usually so focused on "doing things" that I don't get to enjoy those kinds of moments. They are so relaxing and rejuvenating though, I really should pause and enjoy them more often. Those moments are probably the secret to a long and happy life, just waiting there to be discovered and enjoyed!

Since I am thinking of her, today's photo is of Sadie enjoying the winter sun. It is from a few years ago though, and we don't have that much snow here at the moment.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
