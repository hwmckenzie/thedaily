Hi,

I think today is the first time it has felt like a "real" Friday since the spring! This week was a relatively normal work week, and although I do have some chores to do around the "farm" this weekend, we won't be madly constructing the chicken coop as we were last weekend. After almost a week in their coop, the chickens are settling in and I am breathing a few sighs of relief. The coop is working as I imagined it would, and we even experienced at least one quite cold day this week, during which it performed well. We still might make an adjustment to our heating, and I regret a little cheaping out on the second window as it is frosting up when the other higher quality one is not, but overall, success! That isn't to say our chickens are completely settled. Last night we had two of them in the house for some spot bathing to remove some poop, and discovered they have mites. So, one of the projects this weekend is to figure out how to evict those very unwanted guests from our chickens.

I am also going to do a bit of preparing in case any of our sheep are in fact pregnant and planning to lamb in the near future. So far they continue to shun their shed, but I am going to clean out the Bat Shed in case we need to create a few "nursery cubicles" for the sheep to use for the first few days after they lamb. Apparently these are called "lambing jugs". I have no idea how we would get the sheep into the shed, but maybe they will be more inclined when they have lambs they want to take to some safe spot.

Today's photo is of a cat that Chris found on the side of the road and brought home. Quite appropriate for Friday the Thirteenth. We have been keeping it in the office while we wait to see where we should take it home. Chris posted on the Innisfree Facebook page and based on responses we have determined the owner, but are waiting to hear if they want it back. It sounds like it was already returned home once today by someone else. If the original owner doesn't want it, there is interest from someone else, so it doesn't look like it will be staying with us. So far we have fed it a can of tuna and a pork chop. The dogs remain unaware of the interloper.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
