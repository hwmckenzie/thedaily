Hi!

A very short email tonight as it is LATE. And it was Quite The Day! Nothing too crazy, just very, very long. Seuss and I are in Whitecourt and tomorrow we will get filmed for a video about how the dogs are sniffing out wild boar scat. Seuss is getting his beauty sleep so he can look good on camera. Hopefully I will join him soon!

Today's photo is from our wedding since today is our two year anniversary! Thanks to Brad for all the great photos, they really bring back memories of a great day.

Hugs,
Hannah
