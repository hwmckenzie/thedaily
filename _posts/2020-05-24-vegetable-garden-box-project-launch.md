Hi,

We had great weather today, so another busy day of outdoor work. But, we did start out by enjoying our morning coffee and a bit of relaxing after our dog walk before getting to work. It is Sunday after all! The dogs are on a streak of sticking around on our walks (or rather, I am on a streak of making them stick around!). Now that I have written that I will have to be extra diligent tomorrow as they will all be looking to go on the lamb!

The plants we moved to the greenhouse yesterday are still looking a little droopy, particularly the ones we started as they were still just in their tiny peat pucks. The ones Marlene gave us were in larger pots and seem to be doing much better. We're not sure if it is too much heat, or too much sun, or both that is doing them in. We tried to adjust by venting the greenhouse and setting up some shade material, so we'll see if that helps. I think some of our small tomatoes are done for though :(.

After our big day of garden box construction, we cut into the first watermelon of the summer and it was very refreshing. Everyone enjoyed it, including the dogs and the chickens. We finally found something the chickens got excited about!

Today's photo is of our vegetable garden box progress. We are planning to have a set of stairs between the boxes, possibly with planter pots on the steps. We'll also need to add some sort of lattice behind the boxes in summer to prevent the dogs from descending and ascending onto the deck via the vegetable garden. Not cool! We managed to get the ground leveled and the foundation laid and secured to the ground with rebar. We were foiled at the very last minute as the final corner in the second box somehow ended up not square, despite our diligent use of our square! So, we will need to pull out the rebar and make some adjustments, but we decided to leave that job until another day. So close! the decision to wrap it up for the night was also hurried along by the arrival of the season's first mosquitoes and no-see-ums. I can't say I missed them!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
