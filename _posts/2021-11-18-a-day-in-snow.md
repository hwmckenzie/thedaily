Seuss and I spent the day wading through snow in search of wild boar scat. To summarize our day. No boar scat found. Seuss proved he is not one to be slowed down by a little snow, or even a lot of snow! While I am no Seuss, I fared not too badly, thanks to regular yoga and our morning dog walks. Heather and I had a nice few days. Yesterday we saw the most amazing bird. I was going to share a photo, but it really doesn't do it justice. We thought it was a golden eagle, but after a bit of reading I am leaning more towards an immature bald eagle. I didn't know this, but in reading about bald eagles I learned it takes them about five years to reach their final plumage and before that they lack the distinct white head feathers. We saw it at the end of the day sitting on a fence post. As we got closer, it took off. I was struck by how huge the wingspan was and how orange and large its feet were!

Here at home, our slightly more pedestrian house chicken seems to be improving. She is eating again and pooping a bit more. At the moment I am mixing some whey from our recent yogurt making in with her water in the hopes of establishing a healthier biome in her crop. Tomorrow I'll be working at home all day so as I sit at my computer I can listen to see if she is still making gurgling noises. Gurgling is not good as it is a sign that her crop is in a state of fermentation! While I am optimistic, Sad Chicken also rallied before succumbing, so I am cautiously optimistic.

Today's photo is a throwback to this time in 2019 when I was wandering around the wilds of Chile with Zoey and Chris. Dogs have certainly taken me to some wonderful places.
