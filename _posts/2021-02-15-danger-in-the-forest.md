Hi,

This morning on our walk the dogs found a dead coyote. There is some uncertainty about how it came to be dead. It was skinned, so definitely human-caused. However we're not sure if it was shot or trapped. We are very much hoping it is the first. I am quite sure that trapping is not allowed in the conservation area, though it is always possible that someone is going outside the rules. I know that hunting is allowed there, but I'm not sure about the rules for coyotes. Anyway, we are going to investigate further tomorrow without the dogs to see if we see any evidence of traps, and also maybe talk to Fish & Wildlife to better understand the regulations. It would be terrible if someone started trapping where we walk our dogs, since then we couldn't walk there anymore. Here's hoping this all comes to nothing.

I made some long awaited progress on my permaculture project this afternoon. If you are looking for more to read you can take a look at my newest post on [The Property Report](https://propertyreport.upnix.com/), which includes an aerial tour of the property. I am no Steven Spielberg or David Attenborough, but I thought I did alright!

Today's photo is in the artistic direction. I have seen this lichen a few times now on my evening walks, and tonight I felt it was warm enough that I could take my mitts off quickly to take a photo! It really wasn't very warm, but apparently my body has re-calibrated, as long as it is not standing in the wind.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
