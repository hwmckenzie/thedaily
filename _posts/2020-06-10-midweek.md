Hi,

Today we walked with the dogs down to the slew to see how high the water was. Usually we only go down there in the winter to walk on the ice. It was quite neat to see it with water, which was quite deep almost right at the shore thanks to the beavers. Revi went from dry to waterlogged within just a few steps! We also saw what I think is an arrowhead plant, which I've learned from Google has edible tubers. So, we will have to go back and see if we can find some to harvest. 

Today's photo is from our walk to the slew, featuring Chris demonstrating his balance skills while crossing a slippery log with Seuss looking on! I also crossed, with less acrobat grace, but did manage to remain dry.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
