We had a snow day today! It wasn't really quite the same as I remember from my childhood. Now that we all work from home anyway, it was mostly a regular day. Though with the wind howling and the snow blowing, it did give me the feeling of being snowed in. Which we might be! We didn't try to go down our driveway, but initial reconnaissance during our dog walk suggests it is up in the air as to whether Chaser would make it out. Hopefully our plow driver comes by soon!

Our house chicken is a bit sad. After observing her for a day I am pretty confident she has sour crop, which happens when the yeast in the crop gets out of balance. This is not good as I think it is what did in Sad Chicken. However, we learned from our experience with Sad Chicken. I bought and read a book about chicken health after she passed, so at least we are a bit better informed this time. Tonight we tried to give her a dose of epsom salts in water as the book recommends, which is supposed to help flush out any food stuck in her crop which is causing problems. Force feeding a reluctant chicken turns out to be quite challenging, so we switched to having her just drink the mix on her own over the next 24 hours. Once that is done we are supposed to give her a solution of copper sulfate. Unfortunately we don't have any at the moment, but hopefully tomorrow we can get some from our farm store.

Today's photo is of our Christmas lights. Originally I had planned not to turn them on until Dec 1, but with the snow last night Chris said he'd like them on. And since he was the one on the ladder putting them up, who am I to argue? And it did snow after all!
