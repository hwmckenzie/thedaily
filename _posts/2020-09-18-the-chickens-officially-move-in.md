Hi,

Today was a big day for many of the residents of our house. Some good and some less good. It was Chris's birthday (though we are celebrating tomorrow afternoon). Seuss lost his frisbee in a wheat field (though we are hopeful we can find it tomorrow with Chris's drone). Revi had a very fun walk with lots of running, but is now limping and a little sad. We moved the chicken coop and the chickens into the yard in the hopes that they will be better protected from hungry foxes and coyotes. This required quite a feat of engineering by Chris to install the wheels and then some feats of strength by both of us to move it, which was made much more challenging by the long grass. This "mobile" chicken coop is definitely not a breeze to move.. or I need to start working out more! Although the dogs were on their best behaviour, after about 20 minutes of watching the chickens, Sadie had used up her self control and made a pass at one. Luckily for the chicken she missed and we were close enough to prevent a second attempt. I will have to spend some time making sure the dogs understand that the chickens are part of the household, and as such not to be eaten! I was also able to continue building the winter coop, which was quite sweaty business in what seems to be our second summer this week.

Today's photo is of NewB and our rooster (who is still looking for a name) attempting to roost on our fence. The chickens didn't seem to quite pick up on the fact that their beds were in a new location, even after we showed them. As dusk approached there was much clucking and fussing as they tried to figure out what to do. These two set themselves up on our fence and the rest hunkered down in the bush beside where their coop used to be. I don't think either group would have been very safe overnight. At Chris's suggestion we waited until it was dark, and then we went out with flashlights and caught them and carried them to their coop. They are now all tucked in, and will hopefully know where they are when they wake up tomorrow!

Hugs,
Hannah
