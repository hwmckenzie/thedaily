Tonight was the night! The chickens have officially moved into their winter coop for the season. After work today Chris and I put the finishing touches on the coop. I closed the summer coop so the chickens wouldn't go to bed in there before we were ready for them. When I noticed they were all gathered around the door wondering why their bedroom was out of service, I called them over with some scratch and (with a bit of work!) enticed them all into the solarium to wait. Once we were ready, we opened the chicken door and waited with baited breath to see who would come in to investigate first, and what they would think of the luxury accommodation we had created for them. As it happened, Kashlyn was the first to check out the new digs. After a bit we retreated to give them some time to settle in, though we were able to spy on them thanks to a camera Chris had put up. This allowed us to watch as they figured out how to get up to the roost, and then watch all the shuffling, positioning, repositioning, and head pecking involved with settling down for the night in a new place. If you want to see a tour of the coop as well as the first few chickens to check it out, you can watch the video [here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/5d9N6dQXz6WPF6YX7 "here").

Today's photo is of a traffic jam I encountered yesterday when leaving Elk Island National Park to head home after my day out with Seuss. Sometimes you just have to wait for others to go by at their own pace!
