Hi,

Another day filled with fuzzy cuteness. It is very hard to concentrate on things like emails and spreadsheets when tiny fluff balls are peeping and chirping beside your desk! And I am not the only one having trouble concentrating. Seuss doesn't know if he should be setting up his surveillance by the pantry where his food is kept or the brooder where the chicks are. I think the chicks are winning out for his attention though. He spends so much time staring down at them I would not be surprised if they thought he was their mother! Revi is also enthralled with the chicks, and all her excitement over them has made it so she has a very bad case of "ants in pants", as I call it when she gets antsy and can't chill out.

While our attention has been focused on the chicks, the hens proved today that they can leave their fenced area if they want. We found one on the outside yesterday and two outside today. Chris just went to check the summer coop and found four eggs, so clearly it is not Fort Knox and we have some work to do.

Today's photo is another of the chicks. Now that they have been in their brooder for a few days, we have decided to turn off the live stream for a little while. The chicks thank all their fans for the encouragement during the hatch and while they were getting settled in the brooder. We may revive the chick-cam for their next big life event which will be moving outside, though it is ways down the road yet. Particularly since it snowed here today!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
