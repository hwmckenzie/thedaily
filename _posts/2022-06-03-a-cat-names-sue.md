The property now has a cat! After he hung around for a bit, we decided the cat should have a home. He was very friendly and really seemed like he knew what it was like to be someone's cat. How he came to our property I'm not sure, but it looks like he is staying. Earlier this week we took him to the vet to get neutered, vaccinated and de-wormed. We have named him Sue, since he'll need to be tough to live with all the dogs. So far Sue is an outdoor cat, but we are softies, so I'm sure he'll move inside at some point.

Marlene came out yesterday for lunch and also brought new energy to the garden. Between what we did yesterday and my efforts today, I think things have moved from a planting stage to a maintaining and waiting for growth stage (i.e. watering and weeding!). I am very thankful that I did not put the greenhouse plants in the solarium. After watching the sun over the last week or so and observing the effect of the new leaves on the trees overhead, I've confirmed that despite the name, it is really only part sun. The original greenhouse location is much better for the sun-loving plants. It will be interesting to see how the polyculture does in the solarium. It might be that I need to find some shade-loving plants for that spot.

Today's photo is of Sue enjoying some time inside with us after his big day at the vet. He got a bandana with fish on it!
