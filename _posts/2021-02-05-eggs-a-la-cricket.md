Hi,

We are hunkering down for a cold weekend here. I set the sheep up with some additional straw and Chris put our backup heater into the chicken coop. He's got it set up so that it comes on automatically if the main heater (which is safer, but smaller) can't keep up. I think the backup heater is pretty safe as well, but it needs to be cleaned regularly as it builds up dust. I expect that we are codling our chickens a little, and perhaps future generations of chickens will need to be tougher. I don't think we'd get leghorns again. They are great layers, but not really adapted for Alberta. To fortify the chickens for the weekend, Chris made them a special mash today including scrambled eggs, scratch, feed, popcorn, and crickets. I could smell it cooking while I was finishing up my yoga at lunch and it was, hmmmm.... interesting!

Tonight Chris and I took a tour down the river Seine, or at least, that was the plan. The tour guides used Google Earth to show us around some of the famous sights of Paris located along the river. While it was interesting, based on the description we thought they were going to take us on a real boat, so visiting virtual Paris on the internet was a bit of a letdown.

Today's photo is of our poinsettia. It didn't flower over Christmas, but has a small bright red flower now. I've been watching it over the last week or so, and thought of it yesterday when my uncle Bob sent me a photo of his (much more robust looking) poinsettia. I am still quite proud of ours, understated as it is. It has survived, thanks to Chris's care, since Christmas of 2019! 

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
