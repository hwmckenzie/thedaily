Hello!

Seuss and I made it home to our little property on Thursday in time for a late dinner. Friday I unpacked and Chris's mom stopped by for a visit, bringing along Chris's birthday present (skates!) and some pre-made meals. My hero! Today Chris and I attended our first "Pumper driver/operator" class which we are taking through the fire department. It will teach us how to drive the pumper truck and how to get water flowing through hoses of various sizes and for various distances. Today we practiced driving and tomorrow we start with more pumping topics.

When we got home after our big day of learning, we set up the last section of snow fence for our sheep's "winter" area, and then I successfully lured them in there with some oats and my singing! I am going to wait to see if they are still in there tomorrow morning before declaring victory. This will be their first night away from their original shed and I'm not sure if they have warmed to the sheep shed we custom built for them, even though Chris and I did our best to increase its curb appeal.

Today's photo is from our walk this morning. There was a low fog and when we climbed up our hill it was like flying above the clouds.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
