Hi,

We are a bit slim on news here tonight. While I am enjoying my Friday, Chris is toiling away at school in preparation for an exam on Sunday. I do not envy him! Seuss and I have been working hard on his focused alert, which you might recall we were struggling with a while ago. With a few adjustments to our practice he has made very good progress and I will hopefully be able to start partially hiding the toy he is supposed to find and alert on soon. Although he is a very smart dog, sometimes I think he learns quite slowly. Then I remember that what I am asking for makes absolutely no sense to him at all. Why would a dog rush over, sit down, and stare at something? He is only doing it because he knows it is what I want, and it is what gets him his toy. But the whole process must be quite mysterious to him. He can only figure out what he should do through trial and error. And since I am human, sometimes I accidentally reward him for the wrong thing, or don't reward him when I should. How confusing! This is why I think he is a very smart dog. Perhaps the speed of his learning is due more to the teacher than the student. Or perhaps it is just a tricky thing to learn and teach. In any case, he is quite patient with his teacher, all things considered!

Today's photo is of the vegetable seedlings our friend Lemonee is starting for us. She started them tonight and is obviously quite organized with all the color-coding. This demonstrates to me that she is already doing better than we did last year. We drew a paper map showing what things were what based on their location in the tray. While good in theory, unfortunately in practice the map was rendered quite useless after yours truly got a little excited with the watering and sent all the little seedlings bobbing around in the rising tide. By the time the water receded they had rearranged themselves and we were left with a lot of identical looking peat pods, which turned into very similar looking two-leafed seedlings!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
