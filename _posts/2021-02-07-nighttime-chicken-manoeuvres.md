Hi,

This morning I woke up at about 4 am to find that the house was quite dark. Too dark. None of the various lights, which are usually glowing away and minding their own business, were on. No microwave clock light. No radio charger lights. No dishwasher light, even though we turned on the dishwasher before bed. The coldest day of the year (-39Â°C!), and the power was out. 

Chris and I had discussed what might happen if this moment arrived, and here it was. The problem of course was the chickens. Without power in such cold temperatures, they wouldn't be able to last in the coop for too long. Luckily the insulation bought us some time and by the time I woke up and realized the power was out, it was only just below freezing. After some investigation and a phone call to ATCO, we confirmed it wasn't just us and although there was a team on the way, their estimated time to restore service was 7 am. Time to activate the chicken rescue plan! 

Hoping it would just be a short stay, we set up a dog crate in the bathroom and used a big tupperware to shuttle all twelve chickens inside, four at a time. Chris did the catching and I did all the door opening and closing. Overall it went quite smoothly as the chickens were in their sleepy state. There was one uppity bird who gave Chris a bit of a hard time and insisted on trying to raise the alarm. Despite her repeated alarm calls, none of the other hens seemed to listen and the rooster barely raised his head! 

I also did a quick check on the sheep and set them up with some oats and more hay. I think they wanted to know when the sheep rescue plan would be activated, and why the chickens got to go inside but they didn't! All animals checked on, Chris and I hunkered down on the couch to wait for the power. Just as we were falling asleep at about 6:30 am we heard the furnace kick back on. We waited a bit for the coop to warm up and then shuttled the chickens back outside. As it was still dark, I'm not sure they were even entirely aware they spent part of their night inside! 

After that it was a relatively calm day. Nobody ventured outside for too long and even the dogs seemed to accept that the main activity of the day was laying around. It is cold again tonight and the forecast for the next week is cold as well. Apparently winter has arrived in earnest.

Today's photo is of the chickens awaiting favourable conditions for a return to the coop.

Hugs,<br />
