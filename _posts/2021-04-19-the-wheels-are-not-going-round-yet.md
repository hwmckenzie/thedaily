Hi,

Lots of activity here, again mostly involving the chickens!

Saturday was a challenging day all around. After our dog walk, I high-tailed it into town to get the last few supplies for the Chickshaw, while Chris did chores and then started setting up the dog run with a kennel for the chicks. We had decided we couldn't take the dust in the house anymore and they were also starting to smell. Time to move out! I returned just after lunch to realize that I didn't have what I needed to attach my bike tires to the shaw. Determined to get the tires attached that day, I headed back to Vermilion. When I left Chris was making good progress on the chicks new home.

I returned a while later, to discover that my tire attachment design was not going to work as I expected. After a bit more research, I concluded that the bike tires just wouldn't work as they really do need to be supported on both sides, whereas the shaw is designed for tires that can be mounted on one side. I say "really do need" because I had sort of known this on some level, but had stubbornly believed I could find a way to make it work! I felt so defeated!

However, Chris had completed the chicks home and we moved them out, cleaned up our living room, and settled down to dinner and a movie as empty nesters. As we watched the movie, we kept one eye on the weather, which was deteriorating rapidly. The temperature was dropping fast and the wind was rising. Halfway through the movie we decided we'd better rescue the chicks. The poor things were hunkered down in the grass and launched themselves into their kennel when we opened the door. I think they were very happy to be welcomed back into the house! Seuss was also happy to have his chicks back. We were less happy, but realized we may have been trying to move them outside a bit too fast, particularly as it is supposed to be below 0 every night this week.

Despite the chicks moving back in, all of Chris's work was not lost. We have a hen who decided to go broody and has been sitting on eggs in one of our nest boxes for just over a week now. We decided that we'd move her into the new accommodation so she could have some privacy and peace from the other chickens. We moved her last night, so we know now that she is sitting on five eggs. She seems much happier, so hopefully that will increase the chances of some hatching successfully.

Today's photo is of Broody Hen in her private suite. Even though she still looks a little grumpy, I think she looks much less grumpy than she did when she was stuck in the coop with everyone else.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
