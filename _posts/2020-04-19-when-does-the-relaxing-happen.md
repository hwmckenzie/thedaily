Hello there!

Today was another busy day at the property. With the light arriving earlier in the morning and fading later in the evening, I am starting to wake up earlier and earlier. This is an annual cycle for me. I can't decide if I enjoy it or dread it! I keep waking up with the light, no matter what time it arrives, and wanting to stay up as long as it is still light out. This will continue until by June I will be exhausted, but wide awake at 4am and also still going like the energizer bunny at 10pm. At some point I will just get so tired that I will finally collapse and will be able to resume my normal sleep cycle. It is an odd sensation. Like the world is my oyster and I don't want to waste a moment of any day, but also like a small, overtired child who just can't succumb to the sleep they so desperately need. Good thing it only happens in spring!

Anyway, you might be wondering what exactly Chris and I got up to today. Well, we started on our chicken coop! We had quite a lot of wood left over from when our house was built which we stored in our barn. So, we are able to build the coop using this "free" wood. Pro! But, we also have pigeons living in our barn. Big con! So, step one of any project involves cleaning the wood, which we do by spraying it with our pressure washer, scrubbing it with soap and a brush, rinsing it, and letting it air dry. I'm sure this can't be a normal first step for a building project! Then, since of course for some odd reason the leftover wood is not 2x4s, but strangely 1x8s, we had to rip it into a size approaching what our internet chicken coop construction mentor used. Our wood will be thinner than his, but we are anticipating this will just make our coop a little lighter, which will be a bonus as it is meant to be a mobile coop. Hopefully we don't suffer any major loss of structural integrity! Anyway, all our wood is now free of pigeon poop and feathers, appropriately sized, stacked, and waiting for us to start assembly. There is just one pesky little task left before we can start. We didn't have any pressure treated wood for the parts that will be in contact with the ground, so we need to paint those pieces with Thompson water seal and let them dry before proceeding... and of course those pieces are the ones we start with, so everything is on hold until that happens first thing tomorrow morning!

Today's photo represents our major accomplishment for the day. Just remember, many great things have humble beginnings! Revi and Seuss sneaked into the photo as well, demonstrating how they spent their day much more productively by playing in the mud.

Hugs!
Hannah
