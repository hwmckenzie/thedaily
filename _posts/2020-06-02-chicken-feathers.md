Hi,

You've probably heard that if you fall down, you get back up. Well, I guess the same advice holds true about greenhouses. If your greenhouse gets blown down, you put it back up! With this in mind, Chris and I reassembled the greenhouse tonight. I'm not sure if our modifications will be sufficient to keep it standing the next time we have a big wind, but I guess at least in the meantime the plants will have a chance to grow in a protected and warm spot. They look like they have been through the Floral Wars, but are still standing. The peppers even have small flowers, which seems to be a promising sign... or a desperate attempt to reproduce before dying... hard to tell! 

The chickens continue about their business. Four of them are looking quite good I think, with new fluffy feathers on their necks and butts. The fifth seems to be in the throws of consecutive bad feather days. She has no feathers on her butt and also has a bare crop. She seems peppy enough, but Chris and I find her lack of feathers on the underside concerning. We also saw a chicken eating an egg this morning, though it seemed to be just a very soft piece of shell when we saw it. I asked the Fish & Wildlife officer I work with about it, as he also has a flock of chickens. He said that if they lay a soft egg, they'll usually eat that right away. It only becomes a problem if they are eating fully formed eggs. So, I guess we'll have to keep an eye on that. He was having chicken challenges of his own, as their newest dog had recently reduced his flock from 16 to 8 in one day, and he had come home the next day to see a chicken trapped under a flowerpot, while the dog waited patiently for her opportunity! 

Today's photo is of one of our chickens using the perch to take in the view. we have only seen them on the perch a handful of times, so we might try some modifications. We are currently using a 2x4 with the wider side up. Perhaps they would prefer something skinnier, or a natural branch? If only they could tell us. And then maybe "bare butt" could tell us if there was something wrong with her as well!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
