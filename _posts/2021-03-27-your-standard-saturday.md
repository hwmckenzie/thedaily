Hi,

It was overcast here today. We are in a waiting period between winter and spring and things are brown and dry. I am looking forward to the first green shoots! So are the sheep. They are stockpiling hay which they have deemed not palatable, all the while convincing me they need more to select the choicest mouthfuls from.

While spring has not bloomed yet, our compost pile is heating up. Chris turned it today, mainly in an attempt to either dispel or contain the ammonia odour emanating from all the chicken manure before it overcame us. We were surprised to discover that the temperature of the pile is already 60°C! Amazing considering it is only about 8°C outside. Such is the power of microbes! 

I spent quite a bit of the day working on the next permaculture post. My copy editor gave it a read this afternoon and caught a few typos, so I hope to make the edits and post it tomorrow.

Our chicks continue to be cute and to get bigger. Their feathers are growing in on their wings, and tonight we noticed that some of them are starting to get tail feathers! This morning one launched itself at Seuss's nose while he gazed down at them, much to his surprise. We might need to transition them to a larger enclosure soon.

Today's photo is of some of my vegetable seedlings. These one are being started by one of the younger members of our fire department. I think they are looking really good! The ground is still frozen, but I better get my garden plan in place so it is ready when these guys are.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
