Hi,

A very nice day here today... for the last day of my thirties! Yikes! The highlight of my day was a nice evening dog walk. We are so lucky to live somewhere I can walk out the door and head off through field and forest with the dogs. It is really dry this year. The snow has been gone for quite a while and there is hardly any green yet because there is has been so little moisture. All the beaver dams are looking quite high and dry. Such a change from last year when everything was underwater. I think it is the driest year since we have lived here.

Today's photo is of Seuss in one of the few wet areas in the fields around us.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
