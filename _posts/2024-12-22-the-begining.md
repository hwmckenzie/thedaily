After graduating from the U of A and working as a sessional lecturer for a semester, in January 2011 I started full time at my first "real" job. I was ready to fulfill my dream of getting a dog of my own! After being rejected by a rescue (can you imagine?), I decided I would look at the Humane Society. I visited a few times and scrolled their website like it was a dating site. Then one day I decided it was time. On Friday my roomate Steph and I went to the Humane Society to bring home a dog. Steph came because she is a good friend, but also because at the time I didn't have a car and she did! As luck would have it, Sadie had appeared on the website just that day, and something about her made me think she might be THE dog. Steph and I walked around and looked at all the dogs, but I didn't see Sadie, so we asked about her. They brought her out from the back and it was love at first sight. She flopped on her back and looked all cute. She was just so happy, she made me feel happy. I remember that someone else drifted over and asked to meet her, but I told them NO! I was adopting her. I'm not a pushy person, but no way was someone else going home with my Sadie!

Once the paperwork was done, Steph and I walked her around for what seemed like hours. I recall it was cold and wet and icy. I can't remember why we did this, but it was probably related to something I had read in a book. I was determined to be a good dog owner, which for me meant reading as much as I could and trying to implement all of it. Anyway, once we got home Sadie explored our first floor flat. The next thing I knew, Steph was pointing out that my new dog had just pooped in her room. And that was my first lesson in how dogs keep humans solidly grounded in reality!

Here's a photo from the day Sadie came home with me. I can't get over how young we both look!

ps: My childhood dog was named Sabie (short for Sabrina), so I don't think it was a coincidence that I ended up with Sadie.
