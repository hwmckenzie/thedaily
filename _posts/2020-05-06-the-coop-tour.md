Hello there!

We had some excitement today as Marlene and Ron came out to visit and brought a picnic lunch which we enjoyed on our deck, well spaced apart! The weather was perfect and we reviewed plans for the vegetable garden beds Marlene is returning with next week. Getting a vegetable garden of some sort going is one of our next big projects as we have some seedling veggies that are going to outgrown their little peat pellet homes quite soon!  We also tested some prototype shade structures designed and constructed by Marlene and Heather to cast some shade on Chris's office. After Marlene and Ron left, Chris and I walked around and measured our trees. An initial look at the data was quite satisfying with trees reporting good growth spurts last year.

 Instead of a photo, today's email includes some multi-media in the form of my first "vlog" effort. I tried my hand at a tour of our chicken coop and you can view it [here](https://youtu.be/C_hzdd8Z8LY).

Hugs,<br />
