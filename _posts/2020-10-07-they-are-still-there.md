Hi!

I don't want to jinx it, but we're approaching 30 hrs with the sheep contained in their pen! I visited them a few times today to replenish their water and to take them some oats. So far I'd say they are accepting their new circumstances well. The dogs have also adjusted well. They are enjoying their renewed freedom... which means I expect they will start to scheme about how to get into the sheep pen soon, once I have relaxed my guard. However, for the moment I am enjoying the wonderful feeling of sympatico among farm roommates. Not to be left out, the chickens also got a bit of an upgrade today. I added a new roost in their coop to see if I could entice some of the hens to sleep on the roost instead of in the nest boxes. So far there is only one taker, but if I add two more roosts so everyone has their own maybe that will do the trick!

Today's photo is of the chickens enjoying the fall weather. Just like the rest of us!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
