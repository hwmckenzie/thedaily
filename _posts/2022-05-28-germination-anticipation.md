It has been quite warm here over the last few days and spring is really gaining speed. Most of the trees have leaves now and the grass is shooting up. Our haskaps have leaves and flowers, and the cherry bushes tiny pink buds. We have been moving the summer coop and chick-frame each day to new areas in year near our house,but I don't think the chickens can keep up with the grass. If only dogs ate grass we'd save money and have a well maintained lawn!

I haven't done any more planting since my last post. Not too much has sprouted yet, but the seedlings are doing well in the greenhouse and the herbs I bought from Lemonee's school fundraiser are doing well. There are a few little shoots coming up in one of my polyculture beds, but so far they are too small to identify. At least there is also no sign of grass... yet!

Today's photo is of the baby chicks. They get very excited when I go to visit them. I still can't tell which are roosters and which are hens. Fingers crossed for mostly hens!

Hugs,<br />
