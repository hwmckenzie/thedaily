Hi,

The days, the dog walks, and the meals are all starting to blend together, which I think is a sign of a good vacation! 

The chickens got a treat today in the form of half a head of cabbage. Apparently it went over quite well, and there are only a few shreds left hanging. That still leaves me to think up something to make with the remaining head of cabbage in the fridge. We have had a few really tasty meals involving cabbage in the instant pot this fall and winter. It cooks in about 4 minutes and is really tender. But, there is still a limit to how much cabbage a person wants to eat!

Today's photo is from one of my afternoon walks. There is a short window each evening where the light is just amazing and all the branches glow with it. If you look closely you will see Seuss. With his coat catching the light and his orange frisbee, he fits right in!

Hugs,
Hannah
