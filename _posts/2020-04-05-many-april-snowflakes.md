Hello!

After a very busy day yesterday, it seems I ran out of steam today. We did go for our usual dog walk, though it may have been a little shorter than normal. We went up the hill so we could change the battery on our weather station (frustratingly, the receiver in the house still says "low battery"!) and we also swapped the cards in our trail cameras. Aside from a coyote or two, us and dogs were the only animals captured this time. Upon returning home I toughed it out until after lunch, but then gave in and went to have a nap. A very strange thing for me! After I got up, the dogs and I went for a short walk before dinner, and Chris and I did a few small tidying chores.

It snowed on and off all day, and quite paradoxically felt almost Christmas-y. I wonder if the birds and squirrels are feeling the same anticipation for spring that seems to have gripped me over the last week? Certainly I feel their spring preparations and songs seem a little diminished as of late, and I can certainly relate!

Today's photo is of Sadie and Revi, They don't share a bed often, but Chris got this one of them today while I was napping. They are a funny pair. They really are quite similar dogs. They look similar, they enjoy the same things (mousing, climbing trees, digging... porcupines!), and they spend a lot of time together out and about our yard. But they aren't quite comfortable with each other, and have a few scraps in their past as proof. They both like to play with Seuss, but if in the midst of the play they accidentally end up face to face, they are quick to pretend the other isn't there! I hold out hope that one day they will sort things out and embrace their similarities, but maybe it is their similarities that hold them back!

Goodnight!
Hannah
