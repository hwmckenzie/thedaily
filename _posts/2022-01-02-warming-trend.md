Yesterday at midnight the New Year arrived at -35°C. Then began a much anticipated and welcome warming trend, buoyed along by southerly winds, which saw the temperature climb to -14°C by the wee hours of this morning, pulling off a maximum of -10°C by 11 am!

Before I talk about what happened next, I'll say that we enjoyed a wonderful dog walk this morning. It was the first since before Christmas which has lasted more than about 20 minutes, and during which no part of my face was covered and/or numb! We strapped on the snowshoes and did a loop around Tree Island, so named as it is an island of trees in the crop field next door. It was wonderful! The dogs and I also did a second, equally enjoyable walk this afternoon into the conservation area, then back along the trail that runs in the trees beside the road. At one point a car passed us, and I saw its brake lights come one. Assuming there must be a deer crossing the road, I prepared myself to (gently) remind the dogs about how we don't chase deer. Then the reverse lights came on, the car reversed back to where we were, and a lady rolled down the window and stuck her head out to talk to me. Not a deer after all! I guess they thought maybe the dogs were on their own. I assured her they were accompanied by a slightly slower human and thanked her for stopping to check. When I recounted this rather uneventful story to Chris, he commented that it would be very responsible dogs who donned their glow-doggy collars before taking themselves on a walk! Maybe I need a glow-human light so people can see me in the forest too!

The chickens enjoyed the warmer temperatures today as well. They spent some time outside for the first time in a while, and I was excited to see that the solarium got up to -1C! Construction success! We also had an egg-laying high today of three eggs, two of which were brown. We haven't had any eggs from the Delawares (our only brown egg layers) since about September. I realized that perhaps the recent egg increase is due to us providing some artificial light to counter the fact that during the cold spell we blocked off one of their windows with reflective insulation. Whatever the reason, it is cause for celebration!

But, returning to the temperature trend. We reached the peak at 11 am today and about noon the wind shifted to northerlies. We have been on a steady decline ever since and have a few more quite cold days in our future this week. However, no future deep freeze can take away our wonderful dog walks from today!

Today's photo is from this morning, looking out past our barn. I was struck by how soft the colors were, which paralleled how pleasant the temperature felt on my face.
