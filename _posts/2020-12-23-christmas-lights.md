Hello!

It has been another little while since my last "daily" email. I guess I just got out of the habit. However. With Christmas here and covid still raging, meaning that many of us are deprived of the close company of friends and family we usually enjoy this time of year, now is the time to get back to these emails!

Chris and I have received several wonderful Christmas cards over the last few weeks. It is so nice to hear from everyone! I had intentions of sending cards out myself, and did manage a few, but have now shifted focus to sending cards to herald in the New Year. Always nice to have two chances :) 

We did deliver one special Christmas card today though. A few weeks ago Chris read online about someone asking people to send Christmas cards to their Baba Helen (Baba is Ukranian for Grandmother), who is living in a long term care home in Vegreville. I guess Helen had moved from her farm where she lived for 53 years into the home just two months ago, and was really feeling isolated as it will be her first Christmas without family. The struggle of residents of long term care homes is really brought to the forefront during the holidays, but in reality they have been closed off for so long already. Long term care homes in Alberta have been closed to visitors for months.    The granddaughter had tried visiting with Helen on Facetime, but she was struggling with the technology. So, of course we wrote Helen a card. I included a longer note and the first of "Daily" emails from way back on March 21st. At the time I was writing about winter changing into spring and the dogs napping in sunbeams. The picture was of the snow covered spruce in our yard and the big blue winter sky. Hopefully she gets some comfort in reading what we wrote, or at least in the Aero bar that Chris suggested including! Maybe she'll write back and I can tell her more about our farm. Certainly I'm sure she would find quite a bit of humour in the situations we find ourselves in!

While we were out delivering the card we did a bit of a driving tour of Vegreville and a few small towns along the way to enjoy the Christmas lights. I was impressed with how many houses had very big light displays! We also ran into (in the figurative sense!) the RCMP spreading some Christmas cheer with a mini three-cruiser parade through town. The middle car was towing a trailer decked out as Santa's sleigh, complete with Santa himself waving from the back!

While we saw many wonderful light displays, my favourite, and today's photo, is still the Christmas lights on our little cabin. Call me biased!

Hugs,
Hannah
