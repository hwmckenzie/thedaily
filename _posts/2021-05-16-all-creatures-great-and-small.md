Hi,

A few updates to share tonight from the last day or so here.

On Friday I picked up the vegetable seedlings that Marlene started for us, so all our baby vegetables are now under our care. Yikes! I have been escorting them outside for a bit each day to help them continue their acclimatization. Marlene already had hers outside overnight, so they have been living on our front step. This way they get sun in the morning, but not so much of the very strong sun in the afternoon. Lemonee's seedlings are still coming in at night, but I am hoping to have the greenhouse up soon, after which they will be able to get settled. I did quite a bit of work on getting that up and going this weekend. I have built a new large box to run around the outside of it, and filled it this afternoon with the dirt we have. It still needs more, so I might have some more digging in my future. "Mud mountain", which was a big pile of dirt left after our house construction, has come in pretty handy over the years. Unfortunately it is also a large seed bank for weeds... so I better mulch the beds well to try to forestall their growth! It was quite hot today and I may have gotten a bit too much sun. Oops!

The chickens have adjusted well to sleeping in the Chickshaw. This week we hope to take them "on the road" to another part of our yard. I've also made some progress with Stew. This morning when he ran at me, I caught him and walked around with him for a while. When I let him go, he went off to join his hens without a backwards glance. Although he didn't run at me again today, he did follow me around a bit so I suspect additional treatments may be required.

Chris and I moved the sheep again tonight. I think we still have some things to learn about how to do this smoothly. The plan was to set up the new pen, then open up sections connecting the pens and let them move to the new pen with new grass... unfortunately we didn't get the gates lined up, so that plan was out the window! The sheep benefited by spending the evening roaming the yard eating the grass of their choice. I did manage to get them into their new pen tonight with the help of some oats, so all ended well. After dinner I looked out to check on them, only to see that in their adventures in the yard, one of the sheep had stepped on a very small pylon I use for dog training, and gotten it stuck to its hoof! Darn sheep! Luckily when I looked out just now I can see the pylon in the middle of their pen, so it came off on its own. Thank goodness!

The last bit of the update is the most exciting! Yesterday morning we realized that there is a fox den at the end of our driveway! We were just waiting to pull out onto the road when I looked across the road and saw five fox pups hanging on in the entrance to their den. They are very cute! We saw them again this morning, and have put a camera there to see if we can get some photos. I suppose this might spell bad news for our chickens, but hopefully not.

Today's photo is of Chris and Seuss discussing whether Seuss will let go of his frisbee or not. Chris found a cartoon for me that captures Seuss's thoughts on this quite accurately. It was of a dog with a frisbee and the caption was "No take. Only throw."

Hugs,<br />
