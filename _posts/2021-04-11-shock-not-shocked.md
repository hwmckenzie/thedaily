Hi,

A busy day today, and thankfully no more deaths!

We cleaned the chick brooder and set them up with a taller mother hen heater cave, which they already seem to like a lot, and also an additional branch to roost on.

We also took down the snow fence that was containing the sheep and replaced it with the electro polywire fence. Mixed results so far. Revi somehow got in without getting shocked (before we put the sheep back in), but got shocked on her way back out. She was not a happy camper. She packed it in for the day, choosing to spend the rest of the afternoon inside on her dog bed. Poor Revi, all is not right with her world! And when I glanced out just now, I saw a sheep eating from the round bale, which is outside the fence. Hmmm.... The rest of the sheep were still in the pen, and when I went out, the escapee ducked back under the fence, without any shocks. We were trying a different battery setup, so we have gone back to the original. I guess I'll wait to see how many sheep are in the pen tomorrow morning!

Today's photo is of the chickens on their newest perching branch. When Chris went to take the photo, all five where on the perch, but of course one jumped off before he could press the button!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
