Hi,

The rumours turned out to be true and it warmed up today! Everyone rejoiced. The chickens continue to settle in well, although there was a big drop in egg production today. I guess we'll see if this is due to changes in their social network or the shorter days. In the afternoon they enjoyed free-ranging in the yard while the dogs looked on forlornly from inside the house. There was a bit of commotion at one point when the sheep, also given some free range time, discovered the container of chicken scratch I left outside and chowed down. There was much shoving and head butting until I ran out and shooed them away so I could rescue what was left. No progress on the coop today as I had to attend to work, but I am planning to take a bit more time off this week to take advantage of the warmer weather. I guess banking lots of holidays is a benefit of working like a crazy person during the summer... so I can stay home and build a chicken coop like a crazy person in the fall. Perhaps I need to reassess a few things after all!

Today's photo is of Revi waiting for Chris on his office porch. She has an escape route out of the yard and has taken to visiting Chris during the day. If it turns out he is in the house for lunch, she waits patiently for him to return!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
