Hi,

Spring is officially here! The last few days have been beautiful and today was sunny and a very warm +14°C. The snow is melting fast. We are way ahead of where we were this time last year. The day was gorgeous, I went on two dogs walks and also did some yoga, but I don't feel like I really properly appreciated or savoured it. Everywhere I look I see animals that need something, dishes that need washing, chores that need doing, food that needs making, and properties that need planning... which of course spawns a whole new set of things to add to the to do list! After drifting around the house for a bit this evening, emitting sighs at random, it occurred to me that clearly I am doing it wrong! Life is short and you only get one. We live in a beautiful place. Why do I feel like there is always more work to do? Why don't I ever do the things we talk about doing like gazing at the stars, eating dinner on the deck, sitting and listening to the birds? Basically, why am I not enjoying it more? And this is not a rhetorical question! Any and all advice welcome!

Today's photo is of Seuss, and a very tiny Revi in the background, enjoying their afternoon walk. The dogs don't suffer from my discontent, they know the secret to a joyful life!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
