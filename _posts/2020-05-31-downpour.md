Hello!

Today's email comes to you from a hotel room in Cold Lake! I drove up here after dinner as I am commencing some staff tomorrow, and then all of us are attending a virtual training session. Fingers crossed all the technology works... or at least can be made to work, since it is quite likely it will not work right off the bat! For those of you not familiar with Alberta geography, Cold Lake is about 2.5 hours north of Innisfree where Chris and I live. It is a nice drive and I am quite familiar with it as one of the inspection station I supervise is up here. The folks at the Ramada are also quite familiar with me, and even asked if Seuss was with me tonight when I checked in! In fact Seuss stayed at home with Chris as driving and virtual training sessions aren't really his thing! Cold Lake is in fact on a very large lake and overall is a nice town. One of its claims to fame is that it is home to 4 Wing, one of Canada's air bases, and I have on occasion been taken off guard are jets buzz by overhead.

Before heading up here, Chris and I enjoyed a good day at home. We had a slower start, which was good as I am trying to catch up on sleep. I think I am almost at the point where I can sleep through the early morning light. A good thing as it gets light here at about 3:30! Even the dogs are sleeping through it now. In the afternoon we continued work on the dog run garden boxes. We built two more and filled them with soil. We are digging the soil from a hill near Chris's office. The soil digging today was slightly delayed as there was a Hunt's bumblebee circling our soil mining area. At the time I told Chris it was a solitary bee, but now that I look it up I see that it does live in a hive, and they make their nests underground near the end of May! So, our soil resource may be out of service for a while! With the new boxes filled, we planted potatoes, onion sets, and spinach, kale, and swiss chard from seed. Hopefully everything is happy and grows lots of vegetables for us to eat! While planting, I was wishing that I could be in PEI for the planting of the garden my mom shares with her neighbor Jim. For those who were at the Family Gathering in the fall, you met Jim and saw the garden, so you know he knows his stuff! Our little boxes pale in comparison, but I could imagine working up to a garden like that some day. For those who haven't see Jim's garden, suffice to say that he grows enough produce for his family and my parents to enjoy year round. Quite the feat for two people to manage!

Almost as soon as we finished with our small planting, it poured rain. We had set up a bit of a system to keep our rain barrels from overflowing by having one drain through gravity into a big tank we have, and pumping the other into the tank at intervals. It wasn't long before the rain rate overcame both these methods and the barrels were overflowing. So, mid storm I ran down to the pigeon shed (so named because pigeons lived there when we first moved here!) to get another length of downspout and the kiddie pool we have. With these items in hand, I ran back up to the house and Chris helped divert the rain barrel on the deck into the pool. Following this intervention we captured most of the water, though some manual bucketing was still needed. We have plans for making the water capturing and direction to various gardens and trees more seamless, but we haven't had a chance to implement it yet. The dogs were not impressed with this storm as it came with thunder and lightening and there was much panting all around. The chickens didn't seem phased, but after I left the wind picked up and Chris told me they packed it in early and went to bed.

Today's photo is of Chris bailing some water from the pool into a wheelbarrow in an effort to prevent the pool from overflowing. At this point I was taking shelter inside, after having removed my soaking pants upon returning from my outing to retrieve the pool!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
