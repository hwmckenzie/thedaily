Hi!

I hope everyone had a good Christmas Day. Even though our day here "zoomed" by, we still found some time to relax. Again, great weather, perfect for an afternoon dog walk to decompress after enjoying our present opening. We received such thoughtful gifts, I'm feeling pretty lucky! Even our dogs, sheep, and chickens received some gifts.

Today was the 1 year anniversary of receiving my instant pot. We celebrated by using it to cook the turkey (two thighs and two drumsticks), as well as to bake an apple cake. The turkey was perfect. I can't comment on the apple cake just yet as we were too full after the main course to have dessert so I have not tasted it yet.

Today's photo is our 2020 family Christmas photo, pyjamas courtesy of the Maritime Camerons.

Hugs,
Hannah
