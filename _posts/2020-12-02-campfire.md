Hi,

Chris and I enjoyed our fire pit tonight as Christmas date night number two was a hot dog and marshmallow roast. After all the coop construction, we have a good selection of dry pine firewood all stacked and ready to go! It was quite relaxing to sit outside and just stare into the fire. I was even able to cook my hot dog slow enough so that it was warm all the way through. Quite the success for me, miss rushy-rush. I think the dogs find it less relaxing. Seuss is very concerned about the sparks and also ends up putting his toy too close and it gets hot, which causes him great consternation. Revi enjoys the fires as it provides a good excuse to take firewood from the stack and chew on it. Sadie took in a bit of the fire, but then preferred her bed inside. 

Today the chickens got a treat as we picked up a head of 50% off iceberg lettuce last night when we were in town. Chris hung it for them after breakfast and reported only mild interest. But when he checked again later he said you'd never know there had ever been a head of lettuce there at all. So, we'll have to keep our eyes out for more discount produce to keep the chickens happy over the winter. Can chickens get scurvy I wonder?

Today's photo is from an evening dog walk earlier this week. One of the major benefits of working from home.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
