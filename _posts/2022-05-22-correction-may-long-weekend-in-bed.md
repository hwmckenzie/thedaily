Despite my grand plans, I decided to listen to my body and spend most of today in bed. There was actually less choice about it than I make it sound. I woke up and said to my body "Let's do all these things!", and my body replied "I can't, I am sick and I need to rest". So then I said "But..." and my body said "No, I am putting my foot down." And since it is my body, I knew it could, so I gracefully agreed and off we went to recover in bed. Tomorrow I will ask my body if we can do some planting in the greenhouse, so we'll see what it says.

Today's photo is of Chris and Riblet in napping position. It occurred to me recently that I haven't written much about Riblet and she hasn't featured in many of the daily photos. It is time to remedy that! Riblet is the best snuggler of all the dogs.

Hugs,<br />
