Hi,

I believe I am ready to say that spring has come to the property. I am still slightly worried that winter might have a few teeth left, but I have been making some observations over the past few days which make me think that spring is indeed here.

The sun gets in my eyes while I am cooking dinner or doing dishes. Our kitchen window faces west, so if you are standing at the kitchen counter around dinner time in the spring, summer, or fall, the sun is in your eyes. Not so in the winter as the sun is too low by the time it gets over to the window. While this is a nice reminder that spring is here and summer is on the way, it does make having a blind on our kitchen window is essential. Chris's mom Marlene made our blinds. I bet she didn't realize when she made the kitchen window blind that she was contributing to a happy marriage for her son! There is nothing worst than having the sun in your eyes while you are toiling in the kitchen... except perhaps being the unsuspecting spouse who arrives on the scene just when his wife can't tolerate the rays beaming into her eyes anymore!

The chickens are dirty. With the snow melting the chickens are spending their days scratching around in the newly revealed dirt patches. They don't seem to mind having muddy feet or dirty feathers. I'm glad for Chris's sake, as he is the family cleaner, that they don't live in the house. Although, muddy chickens serve as a warning that soon the mud patches will be big enough that the dogs will start to get muddy as well. And that will make more work for Chris!

The sheep are shedding. While our sheep don't have wool, their hair does get "woollier" during the winter. I have noticed that they are starting to lose tufts of hair from their backs, and Chris has seen them rubbing up against our sheds. I'd say that overall they look smaller, which must be on account of losing their winter coat. It is awfully hard to look at them and not be able to pull out those trailing tufts of hair. But of course they would not tolerate that at all!

Today's photo is of Sadie searching for mice under the snow. Sadie enjoys winter, so she is trying to spend as much time as possible fully immersed in snow before it melts until next year.

Hugs,<br />
