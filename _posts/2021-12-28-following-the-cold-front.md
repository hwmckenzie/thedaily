We arrived back home tonight after a wonderful four days in Jasper for Christmas. The holiday was a bit different than we expected due to extreme cold weather. Minus 39Â°C at times with howling winds! Needless to say, we did not venture out for any extended period of time or make use of the skates or snowshoes we brought with us. However, we did get to visit with Chris's family, in person and virtually, and the dogs got to enjoy a change of scenery. Revi in particular was right at home in the lobby of Jasper Park Lodge, as well as going for walks with Marlene and visiting Marlene her in her room. While we were gone a friend looked in on the chickens. This turned out be a bit more work than expected due to plummeting temperatures. The chickens were lucky to have a very dedicated caretaker who came over at 2 am one night to heat up the coop with his own heater until we were able to talk with him and explain the best way to plug our emergency backup heater into the system. 

Now we are looking forward to a few days of relaxing at home before the New Year. It looks to be a cold few days though. When we woke up this morning in Jasper the temperatures had eased and it was quite nice out. Unfortunately as we traveled east today on our way home we caught up with the Siberian air mass and are now back in it until Saturday.

Today's photo is of the dogs by the lake at Jasper Park Lodge on the one clear morning while we were there. Good family photos are hard to get!

Hugs,<br />
