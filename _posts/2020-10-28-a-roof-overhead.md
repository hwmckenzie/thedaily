Hi,

Winter chicken coop construction continues! I feel we are reaching the "this will never be done, why did we start this?" stage of the project. However, we made good progress today and the roof is now done! We also made the decision to call in some reinforcements, so hopefully on Sunday some of our friends from the fire department with carpentry experience will come and give us a few hours of their time. If all goes according to plan, they will help us finish up the coop and then I can stop being "Crazy chicken coop obsessed Hannah" and go back to being "Normal Hannah"...whoever that is!

The dogs had a difficult day today. When we were releasing the Delaware chickens from their straw bale house after the walk, they were very sneaky and escaped. Unlike our leghorns, they do not come when we shake the scratch container yet, so they were free ranging for the day. As a result, the dogs had to stay inside. With the dogs already stuck inside, we decided to let the sheep out, so it really was the funny farm here today. The sheep are getting quite bold and come around to see if there is any chicken scratch to eat. Two of the sheep went into the chicken run today, which got me thinking that maybe we can use it to catch them when we have to give them their dewormer. I expect that will be an exciting endeavour!

Today's photo is of the chicken coop roof. It was quite the undertaking to install and Chris was very acrobatic up on the roof while I passed up tools from below.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
