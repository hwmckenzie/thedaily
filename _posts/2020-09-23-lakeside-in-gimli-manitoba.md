Hello!

I'm back after two days of no daily email! It's not a trend until you can connect three points though, so we are back on track! Seuss and I are now in Manitoba at Lake Winnipeg for our fall mussel training, and things were a bit busy at the property leading up to our departure, hence the radio silence.

I'm not sure I have too much to report from home as I am chatting with Chris a little later tonight. However, he did tell me that after I left we lost another chicken, this time to an insider. Miss Sadie! It was NewB. You probably recall that she was the only one who ever flew out of the pen? Well, since we moved the coop into the yard to protect the chickens from the coyotes, we've kept them in their pen... to protect them from the dogs. I guess NewB had enough of that and went fly-about yesterday. Sadie spends most of her day outside laying on the deck. With Chris in his office, it was only a matter of time before Sadie realized that no one was around and made her move. Given what I know about Sadie, it doesn't really surprise me, but it is too bad. It turns out that chickens and sheep are not very amenable to following the rules put in place to protect them! As a rule follower myself, this is quite exasperating. However, as they don't understand English, or seem to care about my speeches on the topic, I am trying to be zen about it!

Today's photo is of a friend Seuss made on our drive from Alberta. This goofy guy was hanging out on the side of the road just after we passed through "The Narrows".

Hugs,
Hannah
