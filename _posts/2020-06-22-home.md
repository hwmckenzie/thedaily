Hi,

I am back home, and hiding in the house from all the mosquitoes outside! I can see I'll have to toughen up or (and?) dig out the bug spray, or I won't be able to do anything outside during my days off. 

Tonight Chris and I watched Into the Wild. I enjoyed it. I felt conflicted about whether the main character was selfish or just a free spirit, and whether he broke a lot of hearts along his journey, or inspired people to live their best lives. He probably had to endure a lot of mosquitoes while camping in the bus in Alaska! They didn't really show that part in the movie though...

Anyway, I am looking forward to getting back into the routine of home. The chickens laid five eggs today. It is time to make bread again, and to give Seuss a bath. We are currently conducting an experiment to see if weekly bathing with medicated shampoo will ease his itching. Results after the first week are inconclusive, but not entirely negative. Home is mostly the same, but also entirely different without Tammi.

Today's photo is of our neighbor's chickens. They (the neighbors!) are away for a bit visiting family in Quebec, and have asked us to check in on their chickens. They did leave very big food and water containers for them (the chickens!), but we filled both tonight. The food because it was running low, and the water because it was all full of straw and chicken poop! Their chickens are just teenagers, and they have two kinds. Leghorns like we have and cornish hens, which Chris has looked up and determined are for meat.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
