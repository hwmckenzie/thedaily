Upon opening the oven door this morning, I have to admit that the meringue kisses were a surprise! They kept their shape, didn't stick to the tray, and seem to have hardened properly. They even tasted ok, though were way too sweet for me. Despite the success, my forearms are not in favour of another attempt. I also did a bit of searching to see if you could make them unsweetened, and it seems like sugar is a critical ingredient. So, I don't think I'll be adding those to my cookie bags. I did make some almond biscotti today to see if that would do, but I may need to find another recipe. They taste good, but the consistency is not quite right. The reviewer called them "dried toasts". Hmmmmm.

Today's photo is at the end of the dog walk yesterday as I returned to the house. It was a long walk, so pretty dark by the time we got back. Things are looking Christmassy with December 1st just around the corner!

Hugs,<br />
