Hello,

Well, day two in Medicine Hat. It was a good day, but I'm suffering now due to a lack of sleep. I was up late last night, and then Seuss woke me up early this morning with much scratching and licking and panting. Grrrrr! He is generally an itchy guy, but he seems to go through phases when it is particularly bad. I think we'll have to consult the vet when we get home, or both of us will go crazy!

Chris reports that the chickens are doing well, and are fond of strawberries. 

Today's photo is of the barns on the property across the road from us. Chris is corresponding with a company that looks for old photos of properties, and he sent this photo along to help them narrow down their search. Quite picturesque!

Hugs and goodnight,<br />
Hannah
