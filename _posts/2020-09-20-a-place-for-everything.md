Hello!

Many things happened today, but the best is that all the animals are in their respective parts of the yard! ... At least I think the sheep are still in their pen. I am nervous to look lest I startle them and cause them to jump the fence! We had to get stern with the chickens and close them into their pen for the day. Even though we moved their coop into the yard, they kept wandering back out to forage in their old stomping ground. But it is not safe! We have a very bold coyote in the neighborhood who is following us on our dog walks and also cruises by our front step in search of chickens. I have no doubt it took the first two, and I think we interrupted a serious attempt at number three about lunchtime today. It was at that point that we locked the chickens in their pen, which was just in time as I caught the coyote lurking twice this afternoon! I'm not quite at the point where I would take a serious shot at it... but I wouldn't mind if someone else did! Before dinner Chris and I moved the sheep shed to the pen we have set up for the sheep over the winter (fingers crossed!). Originally we were thinking we'd need someone with some equipment to come and pull it to its new location as it is quite heavy. But, we really wanted it moved, and then inspiration struck. We scavenged a few fence posts that were laying around and used them to roll it! It was a true feat of engineering, and how I plan to move all our small buildings in the future. Compared to the effort required to move the much lighter chicken coop into the yard yesterday, even with it having wheels at one end, this was a breeze! I don't think I even broke a sweat! I cannot overstate how smart I felt as we rolled a 5'x8' shed, complete with wood siding, into position. It is not everyday that you get to pat yourself on the back for your ingenuity!

Today's photo is of Chris and I moving the sheep shed. I was so proud of how smart we were, you'd think we'd invented the wheel!

Hugs,
Hannah
