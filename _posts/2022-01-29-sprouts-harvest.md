Another beautiful day here (sunny!) and some more trails recorded. The dogs are all zonked out for the night. I am behind on processing and mapping though, so the next post in the trails series is still forthcoming!

However, I do have a big sprout harvest to report tonight. A week ago today I started the sprouts. I have been diligently watering them twice a day, and tonight for dinner we enjoyed the first harvest on a tuna sandwich. Tomorrow I will harvest more for the chickens and perhaps another sandwich before starting another round. The broccoli and sandwich booster mix tasted similar, but the bean salad mix turned out quite spicy, which I did not expect.

Today's photo is of our dinner, artfully presented, including tuna sandwich, dill pickles, and chips. I was inspired in this presentation by my Uncle Bob's meal and snack offerings, though Chris and I were not mid-bike or walk at the time of consumption!

Hugs,<br />
