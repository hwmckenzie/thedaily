Hi!

A quick email tonight as I left it a bit late and am looking forward to bed. Seuss and I are back in Whitecourt looking for boar poop. It snowed a bit overnight, but luckily wasn't too cold today. Speaking of poop, we have an update on our trial run with the "loveable loo." You may recall that we were testing out using a bucket for a toilet. Well, the results are in and we have decided to go back to our Nature's Head composting toilet... and we might even go so far as to get a traditional flush toilet in the near future. We found the loveable loo was more work and led us to have a slightly cosier relationship with our waste products than we'd like. So, now you know! If you come visit us you won't need to worry that you'll have to use a bucket for a toilet!

Today's photo is of our chickens braving the snow for some special morning treats. This is the first morning with snow, but Chris said they all came out and were running around the yard later in the day. To help them warm up in the morning we have been soaking scratch, oats, and their food in hot water. We have also been adding dried crickets which came to them in a care package from Sandy.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
