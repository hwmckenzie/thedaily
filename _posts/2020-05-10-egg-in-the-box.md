Hello!

As predicted, today was a little slower off the mark than yesterday, but we rallied unexpectedly after dinner for a strong finish! Part of the reason for the slow start was that it was very chilly this morning, so it seemed quite natural after the dog walk to retire to the couch with a cup of coffee. Almost before we knew it, it was lunchtime! After lunch I did a bit of work in the perennial garden, and then Chris and I joined our permaculture online zoom class. Today we started talking about water and how to capture it and keep it in circulation on your property for as long as possible. There is still lots to learn about this topic, and it is a good one for us as living on the prairies we can almost always use more water. 

For dinner we enjoyed pizza made with the sourdough starter, which is coming along very nicely! Then after dinner, when normally we would be winding down, we got our second wind and did some more work outside. We spread some fantastic compost that Chris has been working on, and also installed our drip irrigation along "The Shield" windbreak between us and the neighbor's property. It went up satisfyingly quickly after all the work we did getting it set up and adjusted for the tree spacing last year.

Although we took things a little slower ourselves, there is a lot of farming activity in full swing around us. Today they seeded and fertilized the surrounding crop fields. This attracted a huge group of very expressive gulls, who spent all day flying around and conversing (yelling?) with (at?) each other. Very odd to hear so many gulls and be so far from the ocean or other big waterbody.

Today's photo is of a chicken milestone! One of our hens laid an egg in a nest box! Quite exciting to see our amenities being used. I look forward to the day when I check on them at night and they are all roosting on the perch. Then I will know they are all settled in. It may only happen once it warms up a bit though. With the nights still chilly I think they enjoy huddling together in the straw for warmth. We also oiled their combs again tonight, and will need to wipe down the walls of the coop as it looks a bit like a chicken massacre in their. Amazing how a small cut on their comb can flick so much blood everywhere, but yet all their feathers remain white!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
