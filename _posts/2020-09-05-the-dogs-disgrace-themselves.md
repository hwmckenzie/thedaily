Hi,

Today was a rough day on the farm. 

It all started at 6am when I couldn't lie in bed and listen to the rooster crow anymore. If only I hadn't gotten up! But alas, I did. And of course the dogs wanted to go out, so I looked out and the yard looked peaceful and empty, so I opened the door. The dogs proceeded to take off like bullets down to the barn where the sheep, who had once again slipped out of their pen, were interrupted in their morning grazing and of course ran away with the dogs in hot pursuit. I yelled, to no avail, I wonder why I even bothered! Except for dear sweet Sadie, bless her heart, came back. She has definitely mellowed with age! There was quite a lot of crashing as sheep and dogs went through a patch of bush, but after a bit more yelling Seuss, and finally Revi, reappeared and then I saw the sheep clustered together at the top of the path. I chastised the dogs back to the house and then went to check on the sheep. 

They were all back in their pen, but all was not well. One sheep had a bit of blood on its side, I can only assume from some bush or a fence. But the most alarming was Spray Paint (so named because she has a big swath of black on her side). She was standing alone with her head hanging right to the ground, and didn't come over with everyone else for the oats and molasses. I went to get Chris and we both came to look at her, using binoculars since the sheep are too flighty to get close to. Upon close inspection, she had blood and disturbed hair on her neck, and what looked like saliva. We started to realize that one of Seuss or Revi had gotten a hold of her. Given her sad state and our inexperience, we decided calling the vet was the thing to do. But first we had to catch her so the vet could actually examine her! Which begged the question of where we were going to contain her. So we set about adding a few boards to the sheep shed in progress and installed a door made up of one of the panels destined for our compost bins. Then we went to collect Spray Paint. After a few maneuvers, she went into the shed in their little area of her own accord and we were able to pin her up against the wall, after which Chris picked her up and carried her to our makeshift sick ward. The vet wasn't able to come until the afternoon, and we were very glad when she arrived. It was a bite, and once she shaved the area it was much worse than we originally thought. The vet had to make additional incisions to drain out a bunch of fluid that had collected under the skin where it had been torn away from her body by the horrid dog. I felt terrible for her. She got an injection of pain medication and some antibiotics, and she did perk up quite a bit after that. The vet suggested she would be happier if she had a flock-mate with her, but our efforts to catch a sheep to put in with her were fruitless. At one point we had a promising suspect trapped in their shed, but it sailed effortlessly over Chris's shoulder and out the door, leaving a muddy hoof print on his sweatshirt as a calling card! At this point I wasn't sure if I was more annoyed at the dogs for causing the problem in the first place, or the sheep for being so impossible to help! 

After all of this, Chris and I retreated to eat pizza and watch a movie. Just now we went out to try to recruit some companions for Spray Paint for the night. Not only were we unsuccessful, but worse Spray Paint escaped! She is back with the flock now, so at least she'll feel better overnight. But she needs a shot of antibiotics and pain medication daily for the next 4 days. How on earth are we going to manage that??? I think the only reason we were able to catch her this morning was because she was so poorly. I was able to get them to follow me back into their pen, and I did take some time this afternoon to shore up the two spots where they were getting out, so fingers crossed they will still be in there tomorrow morning, for what that's worth.

Today's photo is of Spray Paint in our sick ward, looking very forelorne. For what it's worth, her neck looks much worse in the photo as the vet had to make some additional cuts to help everything drain.

Wish us luck tomorrow, we're going to need it!

Hugs,
Hannah
