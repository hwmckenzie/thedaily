Hi,

Today was a busy day of chores, and it has left Chris and I feeling like we could use a vacation. A real vacation. One where you go away from your home (i.e. your chores and responsibilities), somewhere nice (i.e. not in the polar vortex), and do things that are out of the ordinary. The first two may be out of reach for the moment, but maybe with a bit of imagination we could achieve the last one. I do notice that one of the side effects of covid-times is that days all start to run together and become less diverse. A quick internet search suggests that weariness with the daily routine is indeed a common experience, and also one that might be good to disrupt!

One of our current challenges is our deck door. This door sees a lot of comings and goings. It also opens outwards, so it is quite susceptible to getting clogged with snow. Over the last few winters it has become more of a challenge to close during the winter as the weather stripping gets saturated with water and then freezes. In order to get it closed Chris has to spend large amounts of time melting the ice buildup with our heat gun. I don't think it was really cut out for the heavy use it is getting, or our climate. Now that the door itself and the frame are absorbing water and appear to be rotting, this winter might be its last.

Today's photo is from this day in 2019. We were on a wonderful vacation in New Zealand, far away from chores and the polar vortex, and we spent Valentine's day in Rotorua riding karts down a luge track. I wish we were there now!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
