Hello!

I hope everyone enjoyed their holiday Monday. I certainly enjoyed puttering around at home instead of being on the side of the highway inspecting boats. I expect whoever did take their boat out his weekend was also glad that the inspection stations were closed... hopefully they remembered to Clean, Drain, and Dry their boats themselves! Only about two more weeks I think before things will be open. I can't say I have minded the slower start this year.

I thought I'd share a few wildlife stories in my email tonight. 

On Saturday morning I woke up earlier than usual at about 5 am. I decided to get up, so of course the dogs wanted to go out. I noticed some robins in our yard, so I tried to make lots of noise opening the door so they had a chance to fly away before the four beasts exploded out into the world. The robins took flight as intended, with all my focus on them I failed to notice the moose in the yard! It didn't quite take flight exactly like the robins did, but it was pretty close! I heard a few large cracks and then it was gone. The dogs raced to the back gate (bad dogs!), but luckily weren't able to follow it further. They spend the next 10 minutes completing a frenzied search of the yard while I took a quick survey of our fences to make sure none were taken down by the moose during its escape. I was definitely not prepared to pursue dogs in full flight after a moose at such an early hour! Lucky for me all the fences were intact, otherwise I expect I would have been standing alone in my yard at 5:05 am!

We are seeing many more birds these days. The tree swallows arrived about a week ago and have set up homes in our bird boxes. Hopefully they can get their babies hatched and moved out before the wrens arrive. They are not good neighbours! I think one box might even have a chickadee pair this year, which would be a first for us. We also saw the first goldfinches of the summer this weekend. They are so cheery with their bright yellow and black plumage and their distinctive calls. Today I found a tree swallow stuck in our ShelterLogic temporary garage. I was able to help it get out by opening the door flap and then standing back, though it did take a few tries before committing to flying out the door.

We also saw (via our trail camera thank goodness!) the first bear of the summer. He or she is looking to be in great condition. Time to dust off my "Hey Bear" song, and perhaps add a few more verses!

Today's photo is of Sadie and Revi watching life go by from their deck beds. They are feeling good because they don't have to go back to work tomorrow and every day there is a new episode of their favourite show "Chickens" to watch. They are anxiously awaiting the chance to become extras on the show, but the producer has no plans for fan involvement!

ps: For those interested, the 36 hour cinnamon buns turned out very well. They were a bit healthier than planned due to a shortage of butter and brown sugar, but still quite good. More like a sweet bread.

Hugs,<br />
