Sadie came into my life one lucky day in 2011. This week, after sharing many adventures with me, Sadie broke her ties with the earth. Although she is gone, she remains in my heart. She is at peace and I miss her.

Looking through old photos, I am reminded of how many experiences Sadie and I had together. Fourteen years is a long time! To honour Sadie and to help me mark this moment, I will be dusting off and sharing some of my memories of her in short daily posts. Stay tuned for the story of Sadie, a.k.a. Sadie Baby, Speedy Sadie, Sneaky Sadie, Miss Whiney Pants... The best dog.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
