Hello!

Chris and I were busy this evening working on our chicken coop! It is coming together very well, and we have plans to continue construction tomorrow. I don't think we'll finish tomorrow, as we are missing some of the parts, but we should be pretty close. On Wednesday I am going to Vermilion, so I'll be able to pick up what we need to finish so it can be ready in time to pick up our chickens on Thursday or Friday. Hopefully they settle in well and start laying eggs.

We've had lots of other birds of the wild sort arrive in the last few days as well now that the spring melt is really on. The geese are migrating in abundant numbers, and Chris spotted a seagull. The juncos have been here for a few days, which is great because they clean up the mess the winter birds make when they throw all the seed on the ground while looking for that one perfect seed. I consider the juncos to be very jaunty! The chickadees are still around, but not as much as in the winter. I think they must be off setting up their summer homes. I have seen a few interesting looking sparrows (white crowned?), as well as the regular woodpeckers and nuthatches. The birds of prey are also back. We spotted a pair hanging out on the air currents over our house and in the tops of our spruce trees. Alberta has a few hawk species, and I never feel like I can really tell which is which as they pass overhead. However, after watching these two with the binoculars, Chris and I think they might in fact be osprey. They are huge! Hopefully they set up a nest nearby so we can watch them over the summer. They might be ok to have in the neighborhood even after we get chickens as apparently they are fish-eaters!

Today's photo gives you a glimpse at the chicken coop construction progress.

Hugs,
Hannah
