A quick note tonight as bedtime is fast approaching! I often find it difficult to accept how quickly bedtime arrives. There is always so much to do, and I always want to stay up "just a little bit longer" to do it... until 6am the next morning arrives! Then I want to stay in bed just a little bit longer! I had yoga tonight (online!), so the dogs did not get their evening walk. Thus they are currently in a state of over-sleep after a full day of napping. The chickens have no problems going to bed. As soon as it starts to get dark they line up to get settled on their roost. I think this is not true of baby chicks though. When the chickens were younger they used to stay up to all hours. They would be merrily pecking and scratching and we would be watching from the house hoping they would go to bed so we could go out and close up their coop.

Today's photo is from our walk this morning. Another success for my phone's "night" photo mode. Frosty, but no snow yet!

Hugs,<br />
