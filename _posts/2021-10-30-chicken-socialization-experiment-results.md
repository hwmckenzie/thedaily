Another great fall day here today. Perfect for... tidying up the yard and working on the winter coop of course!

After a relaxing start to the day, Chris worked on the upgraded electrical in the coop which will run the fan, cosy coop, heater, and lights. I made many trips up and down the hill between the house and the barn to put away all the extra wood and other construction refuse. We also put the lino flooring back down. I think the chickens might be able to move into the winter coop tomorrow night.

While we were working outside we released the light sussex chicken to see if she was ready to get along with the flock after her time in solitary. She was not! Nobody told her off and she was back to hunting the little leghorn right away. I chased her around a bit, but she is fast and can go places I can't. However, later in the day while she was busy cornering the leghorn in the coop, I sneaked up and grabbed her from behind. She let out quite the shriek, but it was too late. She is now back in the Chick-frame. I have asked a friend from work who also has chickens if he will trade us a chicken for her. She doesn't bug any of the other hens, so hopefully she will fit in with another flock.

Today's photo is of Seuss coming in through the chicken door to get a sneak peak at the winter coop. 

Hugs,<br />
