Hi,

Today was another hot day, but not quite as hot as yesterday. I told myself I was prepared. First thing in the morning while it was still cool, I made muffins and granola. I declared to Chris that I was a "farm wife" who was savvy about cooking early in the day in order to avoid heating up the house. I felt smug. Alas I spoke too soon, as 5 pm I found yours truly heating the oven to 400Â°F for about 1 hr to cook frittata and bread for dinner! Not so savvy after all.

I had some concern for a chicken today. The chickens have gotten much bolder about how far they go from their coop, and we often find them hunkered down under bushes and in tall grass. This makes letting the dogs out for our walk a little more exciting, as I have to make sure the dogs don't get it in their heads to go after any chickens as we leave the yard... but now neither the dogs nor I know where the chickens are! This morning I heard clucking coming through the kitchen window, which puts the hen off our property and in the conservation area... where I imagine many chicken-eating animals live, ready to devour any unsuspecting chickens. Throughout the day when I checked on the chickens, I kept seeing only four. There were five eggs, but still I could only ever find four chickens. I was starting to envision Chris and I searching through the surrounding shrubberies tonight for the missing chicken, but luckily when we returned from fire practice, everyone was accounted for!

Today's photo is of Chris installing the overflow drain in one of our vegetable garden wicking beds. I still have hopes of planting veggies in them this year, but I have to admit, the clock is running down. Today we lined the bed with poly and installed the fitting which allows the water to overflow out of the bed. Then we filled it up to test for leaks before we add the gravel, landscape fabric, and soil. Unfortunately when we checked a little while later, we saw that water was leaking into the space between the two layers of poly... so, we'll need to make some design modifications.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
