We tried our hand at cheese making tonight! I can't claim it was a success, but I don't think it was a complete failure. Things started out looking promising with the milk and citric acid heating, and the mixture setting once we added the rennet. We got to a stage where we were supposed to have big chunks of set cheese curds floating in whey. Things seemed a bit unsettled, so we turned on the video to check in with Ella (our cheese mentor). Unfortunately our cheese was not quite looking like hers at that stage. Much looser. We did complete the process as best we could, but we weren't really able to stretch it or form it into balls. On the upside, I think it tastes ok, its just "soft" mozzarella! That's what the Italians use for their pizza right?! We're going to give it a try on ours tomorrow night.

Today's photo is of me trying to knead and stretch our very fragile cheese curds. Luckily the kit comes with enough ingredients (minus the milk) to make several more batches, so we have a chance to improve!
