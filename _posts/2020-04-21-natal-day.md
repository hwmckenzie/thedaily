Hello!

This email is being written by a wiser Hannah! I can say, all in good fun, that I am now wiser than my friend Amy... who of course would point out that I am now older than her too... but only for the next week! Hard to believe I am starting out on my 40th trip around the sun. This rotation started out quite abruptly at 3:30 am as our fire department radio went off, asking for backup assistance for another department. We only got to the end of our driveway before they radioed back to say we weren't needed. I'm not sure who was more confused by our quick return, me or the dogs, but the dogs definitely got back to sleep more easily! Once I woke up at a more reasonable time, to celebrate I spent my day off doing whatever I felt like and enjoying the great weather. Chris and I did an exploratory dog walk to trace the path of a seasonal stream flowing across the road near our house. By the end of the day our weather station had logged 20 degrees! To wrap things up, Chris cooked me a very tasty Birthday dinner, complete with cake and gifts. A true achievement in a time when all the stores are closed!

We also spent some time today continuing work on our chicken coop. I feel we have entered the doldrums stage construction. Maybe others with experience in such projects can advise if this is a common stage? Yesterday we made great progress and we were really starting to see it come together. Today not much seems to have progressed despite our efforts. We ran into a few small hitches that required some problem solving, so maybe that is what is causing the feeling of stagnation. However, we did progress enough to clarify what materials we are missing, so we are still planning to go ahead with the trip to Vermilion tomorrow to get the last few components. I hold out great hope that the next time we work on the coop we'll be forging ahead with the trade winds filling our sails and the doldrums just a distant memory!

Today's photo is of Chris, hard at work on my Birthday dinner. He's a keeper!

Hug,
Hannah
