Hello,

I am happy to say I have returned home from Cold Lake! Not that I don't like Cold Lake, in fact it was a very nice summery day up there, but it is sure nice to be home. In addition to receiving a warm welcome home from Chris and the dogs, the mosquitoes also seemed excited to see me... fresh blood! While I was away there was quite a wind storm and a tree came down across our driveway, and therefore I had to accomplish the last stage of my journey home on foot. After enjoying some mac n' cheese, Chris and I headed out to do some chainsawing so I could drive my van up the driveway to the house. The mosquitoes thought this was a great outing and accompanied us there, during, and back. I hope our bats are back and reproducing!

Today's photo is of another casualty of the wind storm. Chris awoke this morning to find our greenhouse flattened. It really took the wind out of my sails, and I'm not sure what our plan is going forward. Re-reading that sentence, I just noticed the irony in the wind taking the wind out of my sails! It seems like the plants are still alive for now, but how we'll reassemble the greenhouse and keep it from happening again, I'm not sure. A challenge for another day though!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
