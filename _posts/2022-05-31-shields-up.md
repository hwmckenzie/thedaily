It has been a busy last week or so here as the watercraft inspection stations are open and all our new inspectors are getting settled in. Seuss and I now have a few days off and we're planning to spend them working outside. I will work on our gardening and yard beautification projects and Seuss will follow me around dropping various toys on whatever I am doing. Good thing he is cute!

The other dogs are doing well and have a bit of excitement in their lives as the cat is still around... and slowly making a spot for itself in our lives. We might have named him Sue.

Today's photo is of the plants in the greenhouse tonight, all tucked in and ready to survive the frost warning. I learned my lesson after suffering some losses the first night I put them out that Environment Canada frost warnings should be headed, and the greenhouse is not sufficient protection on its own. Fingers crossed everyone is protected this time around!

Hugs,<br />
