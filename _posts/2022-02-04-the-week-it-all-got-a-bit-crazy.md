As the old saying goes: when there are flurries, it's a blizzard... or something similar related to precipitation! I wrote ten days ago about "needing a project". I guess the universe answered and suddenly I seem to have several on the go.

The sprouts growing trial has ended. Although it was successful, there is room for improvement. Customer uptake was not as high as expected, leading to some product spoilage. This has led me to consider a staggered planting regime so as to avoid a sprout glut. In addition, I need to expand my dinner sandwich menu, sandwiches being the only thing I can think of that uses sprouts, aside from salad, which isn't really something one craves mid-winter.

After a strong start, the trail mapping initiative has stalled. However, I am hoping to revitalize it this weekend. With the assistance of the dogs I have mapped all of the trails on our property. All that remains is to put them in the map, name them, and share a post. Then we can move on to the trails that are further afield in the conservation area and neighbouring fields. I foresee some logistical challenges in mapping the those trails as the newest member of our canine mapping crew has very short legs. Perhaps we will need a backpack?

Speaking of our newest canine, Riblet continues to settle in with our family. She has reached a point where she feels comfortable enough to express herself by barking, chewing on errant slippers, and playing with Revi. The latter being very cute, the former being less cute! Seuss is warming up to her a bit and is spending time figuring out where the boundaries are for what he can and can't tell her about where to go and what toys to play with without getting in trouble from the humans. Sadie is also spending more time in society, though she continues to retreat to the bathroom when things become too much. Overall, I am proud of how the dogs have adjusted.

The last project which has entered my life is a chance to do some writing for the [Mountain Muskox Mentorship Program](https://www.mountainmuskox.com/). This program was co-founded by Sarah, one of the mountain guides who led the womens' trips I joined years ago to the Bugaboos and the Asulkan. The goal of the Muskox is to provide safe, supportive, professional and peer facilitated group circles for those who have experienced loss or trauma in the mountains. Luckily I have not experienced this directly myself, though it has come quite close as one of the women I came to know on the above mentioned trips passed away after being caught in an avalanche in 2019. I look forward to the opportunity to help the program succeed in their goal by wielding the mighty pen in the name of grant applications, strategic plans, business plans, and annual reports. 

Oh, and then of course there is my actual job, with all its related projects :)

Today's photo is of the big dogs and I out for a photo shoot on February 2nd for Winter Walk Day. In order to virtually join our work team on Winter Walk Day, Seuss and I took a walk with his home office coworkers. You can tell it is staged because A) Seuss is wearing his search vest while on a jaunt around his neighborhood and B) everyone is on leash! It was mightily cold that day and the photographer was a very good sport. Reminded me of the day back in February of 2016 when we put Seuss in a canoe on frozen Lake Wabamun to disguise the fact that he had a cast on his leg while taking a photo for Canada Water Week!
