Hi,

I have been making slow, but steady, progress on the Chickshaw. Hopefully I will have a structure worth taking a photo of soon. Chris also just told me that today was our third highest power generation day since we got our solar panels! I think that might be all I have to report today.

Today's photo is of Seuss with his very well-loved blue frisbee. 

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
