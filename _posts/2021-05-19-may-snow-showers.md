Hi,

After a hot day on Sunday, the last few days have been chilly and wet, with this morning arriving along with 2 cm of snow! Luckily it has all melted, but it was breezy and cold all day. The chickens seem to be doing alright. We let the big chickens back into their winter coop as the Chickshaw is a bit drafty, which will be nice in the summer but not so much when it is near freezing! The baby chicks have their Cosy Coop (a small flat panel heater) and still spend lots of time outside. We moved the veggies Marlene started for us from the front step into Chris's office yesterday, and they will stay there for at least one more day until things start to warm back up. Not to be left out in the cold ourselves, we put the second duvet back on the bed!

Today's photo is my attempt to artistically capture the blossoms on one of our nanking cherry bushes. I think this is the first year they have bloomed, so its quite exciting. The haskaps are also blooming like crazy and I saw a few saskatoon berries bushes in bloom today as well. Perhaps it will be a good berry year. It might also be a good bear year. One was seen right in Innisfree near the library over the weekend!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
