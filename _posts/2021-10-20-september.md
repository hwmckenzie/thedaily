September was a birthday month for Chris, and the beginning of my partial cross-country travels with Seuss. For Chris's birthday we did a photo scavenger hunt. You can see Chris at one of the stops in today's photo.

After receiving last minute approval to travel, Seuss and I hit the road to our regular fall training destination of Gimli, Manitoba on Lake Winnipeg. It was very beautiful and we really lucked out and got some warm weather. Some years we are all bundled up and wearing toques! Our fall trip got a bit of an extension this year as well, so after Gimli we continued on the Hamilton, Ontario were the dogs got a chance to search some of the infrastructure at the Stelco steel plant. Seuss was not very impressed with the working conditions, which included a floor with holes in it, his worst fear! It was a great experience for the dogs and the humans, and again we enjoyed some wonderfully warm fall weather.

Today's photo is of Chris meeting some cows at Chatsworth Farm as part of his birthday photo scavenger hunt.

Hugs,<br />
