Hello!

It has finally happened. The chicken coop is "finished"! I included the quotes as there are a few remaining small loose ends to tie up, but the chickens are sleeping in it tonight! The project remained challenging right to the very end. This morning we were feeling very confident that we would easily finish today, but we ran into several setbacks. This included discovering (remembering) that we had decided not to buy extra hardware cloth (which of course we ended up needing), and having to face the fact that the coop is so heavy that our wheel design did not agree with the laws of physics. However, we were able to temporarily overcome the shortage of hardware cloth (it is amazing what you can do with bales of straw!) and the coop will just have to remain stationary until we can sort out the wheel issue. This presents a bit of a challenge for the dogs as it is right outside the patio door where they come and go. I wouldn't trust the dogs outside while the chickens were also outside as I feel a determined dog or suicidal chicken could breach the run we constructed around the coop given enough time. But, at least we can let the dogs out under supervision and start teaching them that chickens should be left alone.

I was hoping to include a video with tonight's email giving a tour of the coop, but it will have to wait until tomorrow. Unfortunately it started raining just as we were finishing up and ferrying the chickens over to their new home, not to mention that Chris and I had both had quite enough of the coop in that moment, so we agreed it was wiser to head inside for dinner and leave the film making until tomorrow!

The chickens seemed happy to be in their new home, though I'm not sure if they really understand they can go into the coop, even though earlier in the evening we put three of them in there. They checked it out, then came back down the ramp, so we figured they would know it was there, and maybe tell the other chickens. But, after watching them start to try to go to bed on some straw outside on the ground, we went out and put them in the coop, at which point they seemed quite happy to (re)discover their food and water in there! We built nest boxes and a roosting spot for them, but I'm not convinced they will figure out how to use either of those amenities. I guess only time will tell! 

Today's photo is of the back of the coop with the chickens getting settled in.
