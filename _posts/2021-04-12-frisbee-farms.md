Hi,

Another good day for most humans and dogs here. I say most, as Revi is still recovering her mental poise after yesterday's very hard lesson about the new sheep fence. She enjoyed her walk, but decided she'd rather spend the rest of the day inside, very abnormal for her. I kicked her out to the deck in the afternoon so she could spend some time outside and perhaps realize that it is not the entire yard that is out to get her, only the fence. She dutifully lay on the deck and came back in as soon as she got the chance. Chris and I took her for a mandatory walk around the yard this evening, with hotdogs for moral support and motivation. She came, but was very wary around the fence. Poor Revi. She is a sensitive soul and takes things very seriously!

I also forgot to share an exciting Seuss update from yesterday. While on our walk in the conservation area, we came across one of his lost frisbees! He lost it the winter before this past one, and we spent lots of time last summer looking for it without any success. When we came across it yesterday it was laying in the middle of a trail we walk often. Where its been and how it got there we have no idea, but Seuss is happy to have a "new" green frisbee!

Today's photo is of evidence of some beaver activity beside our dugout. The beaver has set him or herself quite the task with this tree!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
