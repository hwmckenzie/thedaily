Hi,

Chris and I are heading to bed shortly with stomachs full of hot dogs and ice cream cake. The signs of a successful birthday! We tried our hands at geocaching this afternoon. I'm not sure the final consensus on it as an activity. It was neat finding the caches and seeing what people had left, but there are a lot of things to learn about all the ins and outs of it. We just dipped our toes in I guess.

The chickens seem to have settled into their new coop location. Everyone laid their eggs this morning and went to bed tonight in the coop. They did spend quite a bit of time in the yard, but they were still wandering outside the fence for part of the day where they are at a higher risk of being eaten. Though, I have to admit their risk of being eaten inside the fence is not zero! While Seuss seems to view them as members of the family, I think Sadie and Revi are still not to be trusted.

Today's photo is of Chris and I finding our second ever geocache!

Hugs,
Hannah
