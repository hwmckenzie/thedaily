Hi,

Seuss and I got back last night from spending a few days working in Medicine Hat. Sadly it was (very) cold and rainy. However, today was nice and it looks like the next few days, which are my "weekend", should be nice as well. A good opportunity to get the greenhouse up and the plants planted. They are definitly ready to be out of their pots and out of the house. I moved a bit more dirt tonight from mud mountain into the greenhouse boxes. I'm not sure about this. On the one hand, it is free dirt and the boxes needed more material. On the other hand, I'm sure it comes with a good complement of weed seeds. To try to limit the success of these I have covered the boxes with a thick layers of rotting straw.

The sheep have made good headway on the grass in their current pasture, so it is time to move them along. They are still looking a bit ragged with wool hanging off in large pieces, but have mostly shed their winter coats. The next sheep challenge will be to get them to go through a chute, with the eventual goal of giving them a de-worming drench. Stay tuned for progress!

Today's photo is of a rock picker working in the field next to our house. Chris took it during one of his drone flights. I think it looks just like a toy, hard to believe it is real.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
