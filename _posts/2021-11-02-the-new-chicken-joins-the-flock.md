We introduced the new chicken to the rest of the flock today, and so far it seems to be going well! She came out and ate some scratch with everyone (after the inaugural mating by Chief of course!), and then hung out with the flock for the rest of the day. She even laid an egg! She did go to bed back in the Chick-frame though. I am hoping that is from habit or because it is so comfy in there (she does have the cosy coop) and not because she got kicked out of the summer coop. Tomorrow (for real this time!), hopefully (note my prevarication!) everyone will be in the winter coop.

Today's photo is a throwback. Initially I was thinking to use a photo from this time last year, but in the end I decided to go way back. This is Sadie at the end of October in 2011 at one year young! We were out for a walk at Terwillegar dog park, which borders on the North Saskatchewan river.
