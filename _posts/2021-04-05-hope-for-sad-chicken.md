Hi,

A better day today. I think because I got outside!

I did work on my permaculture project quite a bit this morning, so I hope to have some thing to post soon. The posts are currently in review with my editor!

I was quite worried today about our sad chicken in the bathroom, but I am feeling more optimistic tonight. After doing some reading on the internet, I made her some homemade "Gatorade" with water, salt, and baking soda, to help her rehydrate. Chris also got her some real Gatorade this afternoon (orange flavour!), and we have been feeding her that with a syringe. She was looking pretty sad all day, but I gave her some scratch tonight and she ate it! The first thing I've seen her eat in 36 hours. Fingers crossed that is a good sign.

We are also testing a new sheep containment setup. After some frustration using the electronet fencing last year, we are trying electrified wire fencing attached to step-in posts this year. So far it has been a success! It was quite easy to set up, did not require any mowing or raking, and we can fence much more area for much less cost. Seuss kindly tested it for us once we turned it on, and he says it works! So far we have just set up a relatively small square paddock as we want to see if it contains the sheep. I put them in there tonight with the assistance of a bucket of oats, and go them all settled with their hay, water, and minerals. Chris saw one of the sheep test out the fence, and obtain the same results as Seuss! I haven't been brave enough to let the dogs out unsupervised yet, mainly because I don't want to startle the sheep and have them test the fence on their first day. Better they have a few learning experiences first to convince them to stay away from it.

Which reminds me, there are two chickens who refuse to stay in their area. We think they might be flying over the fence, which is bad news. So we are back to the drawing board on that one. Thankfully it is always the same two chickens who get out, and none of the others have decided to follow their lead.

Today's photo is of the sheep in their new fence testing area. We are quite excited about this as it would allow us to move them all over with relative ease. I am excited to have them graze all our thistle infested areas!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
