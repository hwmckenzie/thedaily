Hello!

A good Saturday for Chris and I. I got to sleep in this morning until 6:30! The reason for this was that Seuss locked himself in the bathroom, thus preventing his early morning pacing with nails clicking on the floor, which is my usual alarm clock. Seuss likes the bathroom as it is the only enclosed room in our open concept cabin, and I think sometimes he just needs to feel contained, so he locks himself in there. If he goes through a phase of too much nighttime barking, or I really want to sleep in, I put him in the bathroom with his bed at night when we go to bed!

We had a solid day of working on the coop. It is now all painted, and is really starting to look good! For a "basic" coop design, there are a lot of small details to take care of. While the paint was drying, Chris worked on the person door into the run area and I built the ramp so the chickens can get in and out of their coop as it is high off the ground. We also attached most of hardware to keep the doors and windows open and closed. Only a few final tasks remain! Last week we bought a bottle of prosecco for when we finish the coop...  and I think things are looking good for popping it tomorrow night!

At the end of the evening we took the chickens for an adventure and let them check out the garden. We brought their box with us so they would know where "home" was, and only went at about 7pm to ensure they would want to go to bed after a few hours, as I don't think we would have much luck catching them out in the open. I think they enjoyed it! Each day they seem to get bolder and more adventuresome. In the garden there was a lot of wing-flapping and fast running. One chicken also decided that the paper tags on one of our haskap bushes offended her, so she spent a good amount of time clucking at it in disapproval! We ended the night with a bit of chicken husbandry by rubbing mineral oil onto their combs while they were in a sleepy state. Chris read that chickens can get chapped combs in dry and windy weather, which is what we've been having lately, so this might be the cause of the blood we saw yesterday. Their combs certainly did look quite dry and irritated. We'll see if the oil helps.

Today's photo is of the chickens free ranging in the garden. I did a bit of investigations and there are some plants starting to come up as well, so things are coming to life!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
