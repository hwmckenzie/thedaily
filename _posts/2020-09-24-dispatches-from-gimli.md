Hi,

A quickie tonight! Seuss got to sniff some real live mussels today for the first time in a long time. He is now enjoying a nice chew, after which I expect he will retire to the hotel bed. Not a bad life!

Today's photo is a view of the Gimli marina and breakwater from the beach. The quality isn't great as it was a bit dark for my phone, but I thought the lights shining  over the water were quite pretty. There are always lots of people on the breakwater fishing, and it is covered with some very beautiful murals on many different themes. There are a lot of mussels right in front of where I am standing to take this photo!

Hugs,
Hannah
