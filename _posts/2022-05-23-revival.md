I had a bit of a revival today and my body was on board for some slow outdoor work. It is quite pleasant working outside right now as it is still a nice temperature and most importantly, the mosquitoes are very minimal.

I began by planting the seedlings in the greenhouse. I may have jumped the gun a bit leaving the plants outside overnight and several were looking a bit worse for wear. However, I pressed ahead with all the plants that still showed signs of life. After spending most of the day in the ground, most are looking more lively. I also seeded white clover in the greenhouse in the hopes that it would create a sort of living mulch. So the race is on between white clover and the grass. Hopefully the cardboard barrier I installed under the boxes last year is still intact and will stop the grass at the starting line. To finish things off, I planted some nasturtiums (courtesy of my uncle Bob!) along the edges.

Anxious to get my polyculture going, I moved on to the solarium. I wasn't really sure what my plan was here. In the end, I decided to take a more relaxed approach and just make mounded beds instead of building boxes. Plus, if it really doesn't work out, I can easily change it up for next year. In preparing the soil I benefited greatly from all the hard work Chris did last year to make compost. Once the beds were shaped, I broadcast the various seeds as directed, with a few additions of my own, and likely at a higher density than suggested! However, I think this is justified as some of my seeds are old and I'm unsure what kind of germination rate to expect. Plus, I really want something to grow! I expect this is a rookie mistake, and I am reminded of the first few time I planted the greenhouse with so many tomatoes that by mid-June it was an impassible jungle! 

Today's photo is of the solarium, ready to fulfill its new function. Once it warms up a bit more I plan to take the plastic off as well as the roof to allow rain in. I can't wait until little green shoots start poking up! The herbs you see in the walkway are destined to go into the planter boxes by the deck, which is tomorrow's project, if my body agrees.
