This afternoon we took the light sussex, a.k.a The Bully, to her new home down the road. The place was really cute. I think Chris and I were a bit jealous as it was really well maintained and seemed quite manageable. Our hen joined a large mixed flock including all sorts of chickens, ducks, and one very large and impressive tom turkey. Apparently the turkey doesn't put up with commotion and will step in to sort out any disagreements that don't get resolved quickly by the combatants. I certainly wouldn't cross him! 

At the new owner's request, we released The Bully into the flock. There was a bit of commotion and we did see her peck one hen, but she also got told off a bit and attracted the attention of the roosters. Overall she seemed to settle in well and we are happy to know she is in a good home.

Next we set about catching ourselves a replacement hen. We were offered "any of the white leghorns that don't have leg bands". The leg bands indicated that the chicken had been given a name by the younger daughter and couldn't be parted with. I think the one we took was the only one without a leg band! Chris pointed out that they must have a lot of names to remember as there were probably 30+ birds in total. They agreed, but clearly took naming seriously as they asked us if our hen already had a name, to which we replied "No". Obviously we weren't going to say "The Bully"! Apparently this was the right answer as the young girl had already decided to name her "Pumpkin". It made me realize that perhaps we are doing our birds a disservice by not naming them, other than Chief. We resolve to do better in this respect, so be prepared for us to test out some names here! 

Today's photo is of me getting the new leghorn settled into the Chick-frame. We plan to put her in the winter coop tomorrow when everyone else moves in (construction completion willing!). She already had some visitors tonight, and I'm sure Chief is looking forward to giving her a proper welcome. I think she is a bit bigger than our little leghorn, and her comb is quite large and floppy. This does not bode well for avoiding frostbite. I think she was missing her flock as she really seemed to want to go join the rest of our chickens, and I ended up having to put her into the coop area on a roost when I closed it up as she had gone to sleep on the ground. First nights in new places are always hard!
