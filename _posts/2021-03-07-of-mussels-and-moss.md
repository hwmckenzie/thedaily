Hi,

Unfortunately I did not get a chance to work on my permaculture project this weekend. Yesterday I attended a webinar about vegetable gardening, and today I ended up working. It turns out there is suddenly a bit of a fuss about Marimo moss balls in western Canada and the US. For those unfamiliar which these (which included me until Thursday!), they are a rare type of algae that grows into round green mossy balls, and they are very popular amongst aquarium enthusiasts. Sometime last week an employee at a pet store in the US found an invasive zebra mussel in one of these moss balls, and since then many more have been found. Even some in Alberta! So, our team is helping to respond, which today meant calling pet stores to ensure they were no longer selling the moss balls. Seuss's K9 buddies Hilo and Diesel have already added their olfactory confirmation that many of the moss balls contain mussels, and tomorrow Seuss and I are headed to Edmonton so he can give some a sniff and see what he thinks.

The signs of spring continue to roll in. This morning Chris and I saw a goose heading north. Quite optimistic of him or her I thought!

Today's photo is of the red dogwood I wrote about yesterday.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
