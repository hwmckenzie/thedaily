Hi,

It is Friday night and my first week of "farming" is coming to a close. So far I have concluded that I need to start a stretching routine, and I'm going to need more than one more week to get things winter-ready! Luckily I think I should be able to take some more time off after a week of boar scat sniffing with Seuss. Hopefully the weather holds! But, I do still have next week, so it is full steam ahead.

Today progress continued on the chicken coop. The floor is now finished, complete with insulation. I discovered that cutting styrofoam insulation is a pain in the butt and crack filler is not my friend. Three walls are framed, though I realized right at the end of the day that I framed right through where the front is supposed to go, so I'll have to fix that tomorrow. After that, one more wall to go, but it is a complicated one. Today I googled "how to install a window". That inspired me to consider if it will be possible to avoid that somehow as it did not seem straightforward. Maybe tomorrow I should google "how to install a SHED window" and it will eliminate all the fancy steps? I always thought you just put the window in the hole, but apparently there are a lot of weatherproofing steps. Hmmmmm.

Today's photo is of the chickens getting caught trying to sneak up on Revi. I made them a little area today with the electronet fence. However, as it was not electrified it didn't take them long to escape and head for their favourite place: the compost bins! After several attempts involving copious amounts of chicken scratch, to convince them to stay in the fence, I gave up and let them have the run of the yard. Sadie was inside napping and Seuss and Revi were very well behaved. Seuss says he would never eat a chicken because then who would make all of the tasty chicken poop?

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
