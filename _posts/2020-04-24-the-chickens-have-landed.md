Hello!

Well, the day we have been waiting for arrived quite suddenly today! About mid-morning Chris got a hold of our chicken people, and found out the pickup was going to be this afternoon at 2pm! Yikes! We spent from 10 am to 1 pm working madly on the coop, and then had to go to the meeting place. Although we made good progress, unfortunately not enough for the chickens to stay in the coop tonight, so we were feeling slightly unprepared as we headed out to meet our flock (we got 5 one year old hens in the end)!

We had given some thought to what the chickens might feel most comfortable traveling in during their trip to our place, and had put one of our wire dog kennels in the van. However, it turns out that they came all squeezed into a cardboard box. Although it looked like a tight fit, they were very calm, so we decided to just leave them in the box until we got home. Once home, we let them out into a big dog run we have as a temporary fix until our coop is up and running. They were a bit hesitant and confused about getting out of the box, so I lifted them out (after trying to just tip the box and encourage them out, which did not work!). Once supplied with food and water they soon set about exploring and pecking, which I assume is a good sign. We think they look a little rough though, and wonder what sort of life they had before they arrived at our place. Hopefully they settle in well over the next few days. We have set them up for the night in the van, which will hopefully be warm enough and is secure from any prowling predators. Tomorrow we will put them back out into the dog run while we (fingers crossed!) complete the coop!

Today's photo is of our chickens, in their temporary van accommodation arrangements. We've only seen one up on the makeshift roosting board so far, but hopefully the others figure it out and the board is the right height and thickness!

Hugs,
Hannah
