We shared our sprouts with the chickens today, and I'd say their reaction was cautiously interested. It certainly wasn't the feeding frenzy free-for-all I was hoping for! The sprouts got their attention, but I think they were disappointed that it wasn't scratch. However, we'll try again as Chris says he thinks the chickens need to get used to things before they really embrace them, and I agree. What we need is to have a few chickadees live with the chickens. I've observed that whenever we put out new bird feeders or different seed, it is the chickadees that find it and try it first, and then the other birds come.

Today's photo is of me presenting the chickens with my sprout harvest. We still have a few more which we are planning to have on chicken sandwiches tomorrow for lunch. Perhaps that explains the chickens' hesitation?
