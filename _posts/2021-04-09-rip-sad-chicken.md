Hi,

A tough morning for us. After making a strong comeback, Chris had to bring Sad Chicken back inside last night after only one day back with the flock. She had stopped moving around again and wasn't doing any of the things healthy chickens do. This morning she was much worse, not moving around at all, and when I put her back in the crate after examining her, she just rolled onto her side. After we got back from the dog walk, we decided it was time to end her suffering as we didn't know what else to try. It was quick at least. A bit of a rite of passage for us towards becoming true farmers, though one I wish we could have done without. Poor Sad Chicken.

Being a biologist and curious about how things work, I of course conducted a necropsy this evening to try to see what might have ailed her. It was pretty interesting. I'm not sure it added anything to our earlier suspicions of sour crop, potentially caused by some impaction further down the intestinal tract. But I feel I know a bit more about chickens now. However, I've realized that we need to learn more so we can better care for our flock. If it was sour crop, we didn't follow the best course of treatment, which is unfortunate. Based on my amateur observations, she seemed like a healthy bird, but clearly something was wrong. It is our impression that most vets don't treat chickens, which is a challenge for backyard chicken keepers. Luckily in my internet searches to try to help Sad Chicken, I came across a great book all about chicken health, which I plan to read cover to cover.

On a happier bird note, we saw a Eurasian collared dove yesterday. Initially we mistook it for a mourning dove, which is more common in our area, but tonight we determined it was the less common collared dove based on the black crescent on the back of the neck.

Today's photo is of our three leghorn hens and Stu last fall. I think Sad Chicken is the middle hen. Hopefully she enjoyed a good life after she came to live with us. We certainly enjoyed having her.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
