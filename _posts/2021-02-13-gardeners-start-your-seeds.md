Hi,

It finally warmed up yesterday, all the way to -19Â°C! Everyone was pretty excited. We opened the chicken door and Chris reported a lot of interest by the chickens to look out the door. There were even a few hardy souls that ventured outside, though they didn't stay out long. We also let the sheep out for some time in the yard. It must have felt like spring to them as they got the sheep zoomies! They raced in circles all around the yard with Spray Paint in the lead. I couldn't believe my eyes as I watched them. I thought at first something was chasing them, but I think they were just inspired to run around because they could! The dogs of course were losing their minds in the house with the whole flock of sheep zipping back and forth across the yard. I was in a meeting at the time, so thank goodness for mute!

Today it cooled off again, but hopefully it is just temporary. I spent this morning in a webinar learning about starting vegetable seeds under lights so they have a chance of producing in our short growing season. It was very informative, and also a good reminder and reality check for me to not try to do too much this summer! I am still planning to start some veggies from seed, but maybe when it comes to things like onions I can just buy them at the store. A bag of ten onions for under $3 is pretty hard to beat!

To finish off the day I attempted a new natural remedy for Seuss's itchiness. He suffers from dry skin every time the weather changes. We bathed him last week, but he has been really itchy the last day or so. I read that spraying him with a solution of 50% apple cider vinegar and 50% water and then massaging it into his skin might help. So, now Seuss is damp and smells like he's been spending time at a cider brewery. I guess we'll find out in a little bit if it helps with the itching at all.

Today's photo is from our evening walk. Though it was cold, we all enjoyed finding the lovely patches of sun along our route.

Hugs,<br />
