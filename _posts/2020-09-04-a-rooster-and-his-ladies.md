Hi,

I think the chickens are getting used to having a rooster around. We are noticing a change in their behaviour. They seem to stay closer together as a group, but they are going further from coop. First thing in the morning they head off and are nowhere to be seen until after lunch. Chris says that he sometimes sees them behind his office shed in the conservation area. Contrary to what I believed, the rooster doesn't crow only at dawn. He also crows throughout the day in an apparent effort to call his hens to him, or if he thinks there is danger and he wants everyone nearby. At first the only hen who came was his original lady friend who arrived with him, but now I think all the hens gather when he crows. I also notice the change in daylight having an effect. The chickens gather near their coop much earlier, and are tucked into bed earlier as well. I think their eggs are also getting smaller, though we are still getting five eggs a day with the arrival of the new hen. The pressure is on to get their winter shed-coop built. I live in nightly worry that they will get frostbite!

Today's photo is of today's progress on the sheep shed. We moved it off the deck (it was much lighter than the chicken coop when we finally dragged that off the deck!), and I started putting the siding on. I think I will finish the siding tomorrow and then I will need to confront the challenge of the roof! I think once I am done this thing better have wheels attached to it, or we need to buy a tractor to move it around!

Hugs,
Hannah
