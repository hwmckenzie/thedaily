Hello!

Things continue here at our house. Today was a compilation of many small (unremarkable?) events of daily life. We went for a dog walk and came back with 100% of the dogs, but I can tell that they are feeling frisky as keeping everyone around required a lot more yelling than usual. I suspect now that the snow has melted there is more deer activity, which is hard for the dogs to resist! I'll have to be extra vigilant over the next few walks and crack down hard on any deviant behaviour. Otherwise, come July I'll end up chasing them through waist high canola fields in the rain with my sopping wet pants weighting me down and tripping on my shoelaces, just like last year!

This afternoon Chris and I went shopping for supplies to finish the chicken coop and also to make it a welcoming home for our new chickens. After feeling pretty thrifty for using all the old wood we had, our chicken coop has significantly ballooned in price following the purchase of the hardware, paint, and extra plywood and chicken wire we needed to supplement what we had. Hardware is shockingly expensive, and of course all doors and windows require it in order to ensure a secure coop. All this shopping took longer than expected, so we did not have a chance to make any more progress on the coop construction tonight. This means the pressure is on tomorrow, as Chris talked to our chicken people today and it is looking like we will be able to pick them up in the next few days.

Today's photo is of a rainbow that appeared tonight following a very brief (30 second?) rainstorm. Unfortunately it showcases some of the uglier parts of our property, including our power poll and a large section of the neighbor's junk pile, which he refers to as "the materials I'm going to use to build a shop". Given the state of the materials, I feel he is grossly over-optimistic about what sort of shop might emerge from that pile!

Hugs
Hannah

ps: Thank you to everyone who has sent me birthday wishes, I will reply to each tomorrow. Also, in case it was unclear in my note from yesterday, I am STARTING my 40th trip around the sun.... so I only just turned 39! Perhaps a petty detail to point out... but I felt the need to clarify!
