Hello!

Well, it sounds like the rooster and new hen are settling in well. Chris reports that the rooster can almost fly, and he took a video for me showing him strutting all around our deck. He also reported that the rooster crowed at 5:19 am this morning, though apparently you can hardly hear it with the window closed if you are wearing earplugs! Hopefully he is nice to our hens once we let them intermingle. Seuss and I had a big day of shoreline inspections. We were both very tired by the end, but enjoyed a treat of seeing a doe and her fawm (still with spots) at our last site! I got to see her from the vehicle and then again on the beach in the distance, but Seuss only became aware of the situation when he caught their scent. He struggled to focus for a while after that, but we managed! Tomorrow we are headed home for some rest and to continue on the construction projects.

Chris took today's photo. It seems the sheep are now on a "go where you will" plan. Revi can't believe that they are allowed to come right up to the deck to eat their snacks and she is expected to just watch them do it!

Hugs,
Hannah
