Hi,

Another day of searching for mussels on the shores of Lake Winnipeg. Lucky for us, and not so lucky for everyone who loves Lake Winnipeg, there are lots of mussels to be found. We watched a few very large sailboats be hoisted out of the lake with a crane and loaded onto trucks. The sailing club seems very active here. Not all boats are large, as we also saw a group of young adults preparing for a day of sailing in lasers. They seemed quite serious, so I expect they are competitive sailors. 

From looking through Chris's photos it seems like the sheep are making themselves quite at home! In one shot they almost have Sadie surrounded. It appears they are either inspecting her, interviewing her, or lecturing her. In another shot Revi is watching from inside as one of the sheep actually climbs the stairs of the deck!

Today's photo is of Seuss and I practicing searching for mussels which are attached to the sea wall of the marina. This is a challenging place to search as Seuss is not a fan of the dark watery gap he has to reach over, and less so because the dock tends to push away from the wall as it floats. However, we worked as a team and I gave lots of encouragement, and after some practice he was feeling more confident.

Hugs,
Hannah
