Hi,

The temperature is dropping and the time is running out, so coop work continued today with gusto. Things looked dire off the bat with a bit of freezing rain, but luckily it only lasted about 10 minutes. Chris and I worked diligently and managed to get the gable ends covered, the insulation in, the power connected, and the door hung. And the door opens and closes! Hopefully tomorrow we can get the poly and plywood on the interior walls and ceiling, cut out the chicken door, and then cover all the mistakes with spray foam. Then after a bit of interior decorating (flooring, roosts, nest boxes, and food and water), it will be move-in ready. I literally don't remember what I did before I worked on this chicken coop. I will be very glad once all the chickens are installed in their new home for the winter.

Today's photo is of us at the end of the day. It is nice to have power in there now. Quite fancy!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
