Spring is here, which means construction season! And we're not talking about road construction. I have started working on the summer coop renovations. The main improvements I am hoping to make include the following. I will put it on a sturdier base in the hopes of keeping the coop and run square(er) and install permanent wheels to allow for easier movement of the coop to new pasture. This improvement is on-going as I write tonight. As part of shifting the coop to a new base I am putting my construction skills to the test and trying to do something a little fancy. I hope that I have not gotten too big for my tool belt! I have already removed the nest boxes, which were higher than the roost and consequently the chickens often slept (and pooped) in them which made the eggs dirty. Ideally I will also figure out a strategy to add a chicken wire roof to keep out hawks and some sort of shade cloth. We'll see. With the weather improving, we would like to get the big chickens into the summer coop in the next week or so.

A few other updates from the property. We saw a bear crossing the road on our way home from Edmonton on Sunday night. I think the bears have returned a little earlier to our neck of the woods this year. The migration is also in full swing and unfortunately this year it is bringing along a new strain of avian influenza which arrived from Europe and Asia to North America in December. Everyone is on high alert as this can easily get into chicken flocks, with terrible results. There have already been 16 cases identified in Alberta, leading to the culling of many birds to prevent further spread.

Today's photo is of the first crocus this spring. I was trying to get Riblet to pose with her nose beside it, but she didn't understand my artistic vision! While I was endeavouring to capture this miracle of spring, a thirteen lined ground squirrel popped up and ran a few circles between all the dogs legs. All the dogs were present since everyone had come over to see what Riblet and I were doing. A bit of chaos ensued. Seuss grabbed it first, but dropped it when I yelled at him. Revi grabbed it next, but I had a few more wits about me by that point and she got a very well-timed correction. She was completely surprised by the prey item that bit her back! Sadie came over to investigate, but stopped when I growled at her. As I stood over the poor thing trying to decide what to do, since it was injured but not dead, Riblet, young but no fool, sensed a opportunity in my moment of indecision and grabbed the squirrel. By the time I got her to drop it, there were no more decisions to be made. We proceeded on our walk, the dogs enlivened by the action and myself a little subdued.
