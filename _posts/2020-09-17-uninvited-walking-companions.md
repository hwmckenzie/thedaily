Hi,

Today was a busy day of outdoor work. The weather was wonderful, but after standing and constructing all day I am a stiff and sore girl! The winter coop is coming well. I think by the end of tomorrow I will know if things are looking good... or if I am in over my head and the chickens should start looking for alternate winter accommodation!

For the last two mornings we have been followed on our walk by a very bold coyote. The crop is off the fields around us, so we are enjoying some field walks. Unfortunately the dogs and us are not the only ones reveling in this newfound freedom. This coyote shows up about half way through the walk and then follows and yips at us until we go through our gate. I don't like it at all! He, or she, actually approaches us and the dogs. A coyote that is not afraid of two humans and three dogs is not good news. Today Sadie ran after it and almost went into the woods, but I managed to get her to stop and come back just at the last moment. We've had lots of coyotes around before, but never one like this. I'm not sure what we're going to do about it. I expect it is the chicken thief, and probably has an eye on our sheep. Perhaps our sheep need a guardian animal of some sort.

Today's photo is of an egg cach that Chris found this afternoon. We watched NewB go over the top of the coop again this morning, so it is definitely her who has been laying her eggs "en plein air". We counted nine eggs! I'm not sure what we'll do about it, or what we'll do with the eggs we found. She doesn't seem to want to sit on them, just go off to lay them. The chickens sure keep us on our toes!

Hugs,
Hannah
