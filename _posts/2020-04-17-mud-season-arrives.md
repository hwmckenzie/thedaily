Greetings on this Friday!

The melting is in full swing here at our property! It is becoming difficult to select dog walking routes as our snowshoe trails are no longer structurally sound. This morning we started out across the field, but ended up aborting and returning on the road. Today we also witnessed the start of mud season, with the dogs coming in and shaking muddy water all over our walls. I'm sure it will not be long before they are tracking muddy paws all over our floors too. They have also rediscovered the joy of digging and eating mud. I fear that poor Chris, as head of the cleaning department in our house, has a challenging few weeks ahead of him!

We have begun the preparatory work for our permaculture course that is starting on Sunday. As part of understanding water flow on our property, which seems to be a key concept, we have decided to try to create a very fine scale local contour map. We have a few ideas about how to do this using our phones and some mapping software, and we are planning to test it out tomorrow. So, stay tuned! Now is a good time to do this as we can see in real time where all the water is accumulating, so we can be sure of which direction is downhill!

Chris and I spent this evening doing something I never thought would be my thing. Playing a video game! After many failed attempts to find a game I liked, I think Chris has finally succeeded. We are playing a game called "Baba is You." Baba is a sheep. I'm not sure if my explanation will do it justice, but basically it is a logic game. The goal is to get to the flag to win (Flag is Win), but there are obstacles you must overcome (e.g. Wall is Stop, with the flag surrounded by a wall). By pushing things around you can change the rules of the game in order to make it possible to win. It definitely encourages thinking outside the box!

Today's photo is of me making my way across a section of weak snow during our walk this morning. This is no way to travel for long distances!

Hugs,
Hannah
