It felt like a real Friday today. I've been working hard during the days, I did yoga every day this week, and we've been planning our Friday campfire for a few days now. With smokies and smores in the belly, the weekend is off to a good start!

This afternoon the dogs and I spent some time hiking around and mapping some more trails. I wanted to get some of the loose ends mapped, so the walk was a bit piecemeal with some sections that did not have snowshoe trails yet. Seuss did some snow swimming and resisted all attempts on my part to have him walk behind me in the trail I was breaking. I think he will sleep well tonight, though I hope he is not too sore tomorrow. Sadie was a real trooper. At one point I had to double back a bit as I forgot to start the tracker on my phone. I tried to be sneaky about it so the dogs wouldn't follow me, but when I turned around, there was little Sadie determinedly trucking along behind me. What a dog! Revi was a bit low energy this afternoon, but only because she went on a solo walk this morning to who-knows-where. In my ambition to maps trails, I got us a bit turned around in the bush and we ended up taking a very untraditional path on our morning walk, making it difficult for Revi to do her usual trick of rendezvousing with us along our route. In the end Chris had to go pick her up a little bit down the road.

Today's photo is of the trail blazers and I taking a short break on my bench at the top of the hill. As you can intuit from the photo, everyone has their own priorities in mind and they do not involve posing for a group photo! 

Hugs,<br />
