The highs and lows I'm talking about here relate to my meringue kiss making experience of this evening! I decided to try to something a little fancy to add to my cookie bags. I settled on meringues. I believe I may regret that... though I won't know until tomorrow morning when I can finally peak in the oven! Things started out ok and the egg whites were starting to stiffen. Following the recipe I started to slowly add the sugar. The recipe called for castor sugar, which is the same as icing sugar, right? Nope. I discovered this just now in mulling over possible reasons why the whites remained stubbornly soft. Hmph. But, in the moment, not knowing this possibly crucial error had been made, I persevered, forearm burning (I have no electric mixer!). At one point I attempted to use my hand blender. Big mistake! The lovingly nurtured soft peaks gave way and I was left with liquid again! However, encouraged by the internet, which claimed that any meringue would stiffen with enough beating, I kept going. Reflecting now, likely the internet did not account for the sugar difference. However, about two-thirds of the way through one episode of Heartland, sweat rolling down my face, I declared the whites "stiff enough". Into the piping bag they went and then they got extruded onto the tray into kiss-like blobs. Missing the parchment paper of course because I don't have any, and at least I know better than to substitute with wax paper! So, they are now cooking in the oven and I can't check on them on pain of causing them to crack if I open the door. I don't want to get ahead of myself, but I don't anticipate these will be good enough for public consumtion or that I will be making these again! 

Today's photo is from tonight's dog walk. We took a longer walk this evening and it was very peaceful. But, by the end Seuss started to get concerned that we would arrived home past his dinnertime, and so started to make a determined beeline for home. His progress was hindered by having to wait for Sadie, who likes to spend a lot of time sniffing her way through her walks these days.
