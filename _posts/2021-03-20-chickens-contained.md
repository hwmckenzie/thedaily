Hi,

Today was a busy day of starting to do the spring outdoor chores. We did a yard cleanup to collect some construction refuse left over from the hurried winter coop build last fall, and Chris took down the Christmas lights. I guess that means winter is officially over! We also reconfigured the chicken fence so it actually contains the chickens! Tomorrow morning we'll see how upset they are when they can't visit all their usual haunts. Hopefully they will find new things to explore within their pen and not be too determined to find a way out. I am looking forward to less chicken poop everywhere, and being able to not worry so much about the dogs. I have to say though that they have been very good with the chickens, even Sadie. Though I would not trust her alone for too long in the same yard as them. We don't call her Sneaky Sadie for nothing!

Tonight we spent some time getting the brooder ready. The hatch might start tomorrow or the next day. Chris has figured out how to live stream from the incubator, so once the time gets closer we'll share how to watch if you want to see it all happen. 

Today's photo is of the rooster-dog cooling his waddles. Chris sent me this photo and it turns out it is actually an action shot, so we are quite fancy today!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
