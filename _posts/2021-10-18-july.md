July was a big month for departures at the property. 

After a year of hosting the sheep, we decided it was time for them to find a new home. They were entertaining to have around, but they were so difficult to handle and contain! They managed to eat all of the trees in our yard which we had been babying for a few years, none of them were pregnant, they didn't really control the grass, and worst of all, they didn't want to be friends with us! So, Chris posted an add online: "Sheep for sale. Very good price. You must catch and pickup." We had a lot of interest (due to the price), but were very picky about who we offered them to (due to our belief that most people underestimated how wild the sheep were and overestimated their own sheep catching skills!). The lucky couple we chose came armed with portable fence panels and an award winning cattle dog. Even then it took both of them, the dog, and Chris and I the better part of two hours to corral the sheep into the trailer. By that point, I can't say I was too sad to see them go! From talking with the couple, who had around on hundred wool sheep at home, it sounded like our sheep were going to but put to work helping them train their sheep dogs. Apparently hair sheep are good for training dogs because they are so wild. The couple did suggest we could try wool sheep next summer. They said wool sheep were easier to control, we had good grass and fencing, and if we just kept them over the summer and butchered them in the fall we would get good meat. So, perhaps our foray into sheep isn't quite dead yet...

Shortly after the sheep left we also said goodbye to over half of our chickens. Or I should say, welcomed them back home to our freezer after a quick visit to the butcher :) The three teenage roosters were getting big enough to be a pain for the two poor teenage hens they were living with. Plus the barred rock and the black astrolorp were both shaping up to be mean just like Stewart. So we said goodbye to the two boys and Stew. We kept what we think was an easter egger rooster as he seemed to be the nicest. He is still nice to this day and we have named him Chief Chicken, or just Chief for short. He is quite handsome! We also sent most of the Delawares, keeping only the two with the cleanest butts. We packed them up one evening into cardboard boxes and drove them to the nearby Hutterite colony. It turns out chickens make a lot of heat, and cardboard boxes with a few holes poked in them are not suitably ventilated for transport. The poor chickens almost expired from heat stress on the drive there and we felt pretty badly. We picked them up the next day and dressed and wrapped, which felt pretty cushy given how much work I imagine butchering, plucking, and cleaning a chicken is. So far we've eaten two. The first was a bit tough, but I picked the biggest for Thanksgiving and it was pretty good. Now going into winter we have five hens plus Chief. At the moment only one is reliably laying, but I am hoping this is because they are molting and production will pick up again soon!

Today's photo is of the traffic jam Seuss and I got stuck in on our way home from work on Canada Day. Sometimes you just have to wait for others to go first!
