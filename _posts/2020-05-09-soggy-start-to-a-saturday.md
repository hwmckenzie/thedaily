Hello!

Today was a day full of many happenings, but the best (worst?!) part happened right at the start. I'm not sure I fully recovered until after lunch.

We headed out for our walk as usual, this morning heading down "Moose trail", which is a path that runs south along the fence to the back of our property. It drops down into a ravine, which is usually quite boggy, hence the name, and then climbs again back up to dry prairie. All was going smoothly and I had just commented to Chris how wet it was when it happened. I took a misstep and instead of skipping nimbly from hummock to hummock over the boggy mud, my foot went right into the space between hummocks! I thought I could recover, but the mud took hold of my foot, my body kept going forward, and the next thing I knew I was laying fully extended on my stomach in cold bog, wet from head to toe! Now normally when I fall over on walks (which actually happens a surprising amount!) I lay there on the ground for a bit feeling sorry for myself before getting up. Chris finds this both amusing and confusing. He can't understand why I'd just lay there letting the snow/mud/water soak into my clothes. I can't really explain why I do it either, I just do. Or at least, I usually do. Not so this morning! The water was so cold and I was so fully immersed that I leapt up immediately and was halfway back up the slope towards the house before the dogs had figured out the walk wasn't going according to plan! There was one bright spot though. I was wearing the tall muck boots that Sandy got me for Christmas two years ago, and somehow they were not breached! That is some pair of boots! Anyway, after a quick wardrobe change, much to the dogs' relief we headed back out for the walk, although we took a different direction!

After that start, I felt I had really earned my coffee. I also took the time to make today's sourdough bootcamp recipe, which was buttermilk cheese scones. These received a thumbs up from Chris. Then we headed outside where Chris worked on turning our compost which has now defrosted and is a toasty 30 degrees, and I puttered away at fixing a few things on the chicken coop. I was not at my best though and managed to do more harm than good while trying to hang up our food and water containers. I had more luck after lunch, and was able to get the containers fixed and hung, and the door to the run re-hung post-move so now it closes again. Although I felt better about my progress, I think the chickens felt their peaceful Saturday of pecking and scratching was quite rudely interrupted by so many comings and goings of the human. So far today we have gotten only one egg. We also cut down a caragana tree and chipped it. It took much longer than expected. Those trees have so many interwoven trunks! Based on our energy level tonight, I expect tomorrow will be a little more relaxing. 

Today's photo is of me immediately after my immersion in the bog.

Hugs,<br />
