Hi,

Today was the dawning of a new era. It is the post-chicken-coop-construction era and I can tell you, it feels amazing! We took the dogs for a very nice and relaxing walk, and then peeked in to see how the chickens were enjoying waking up in their new coop. Actually, we had already checked on them using the chicken camera before we got out of bed! Creepy right? Even though it was -9°C outside, the coop was still -1°C, and we don't have the heater yet. This bodes well for our insulation job and future cold temps. Everyone seemed happy and active. We left the chicken door closed until lunch when the sun came out and it had warmed up a bit more. I think once they get comfortable in their new home and we get a bit of a sheltered outdoor area set up, we'll open their door first thing in the morning unless it is really cold. But we took it slow for their first day. Everyone came out and did some exploring and sunbathing under the edge of the deck, 5 birds laid eggs and only one chose the floor over my custom built nest boxes, and everyone was back in the coop and (mostly) on their roost when we went to shut the door at about 5 pm. 

As a nice change from the last week or so, I enjoyed a quiet day sitting at my desk and catching up on work, while occasionally getting a glimpse of the sheep as they roamed about the yard. I'm not sure if it is my imagination or not, but some of them are starting to look concerningly round. I guess I better start reading up on how to prepare for your sheep to go into labour. Hmmmm. At the end of the day I also got the chance to take our dogs for a quick evening walk. They were over the moon, as was I. It is amazing how much time you suddenly have when you aren't building a chicken coop under the gun!

Today's photo is of the chickens enjoying some winter sun. We still need to build them a bit of a windbreak for the more wintery weather to come, but they enjoyed their time outside today. 

Hugs,<br />
