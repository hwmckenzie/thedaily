Hi,

The day in Medicine Hat was bright and sunny. It was a great day for showing off the dogs' skills to a reporter from Radio Canada (french!). We started out at a reservoir and finished at a boat inspection station. Seuss had quite a bit of footage taken of him, so hopefully he ends up in the news report! I believe if you keep an eye on the ICI Alberta facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/icialberta/) you will see something about it sometime tomorrow. Watching how he handled himself with the reporter and the camera, I marveled again at how far he has come. There was a day, not so long ago, when he would have been barking at the poor reporter and jumping around with all his teeth out. Today he just sniffed the camera and accepted pats. So mature!

We had some sad news today. We said goodbye to Tammi. She was first Chris's dog, and then she adopted Sadie and I into her pack when Chris moved in with us. In thinking about her tonight I came across the following quote with which I agree wholeheartedly. "Dogs' lives are too short. Their only fault, really."  As far as man's best friend goes, Tammi was the best of the best.   

Today's photo is of Tammi and Sadie, back in the days when they enjoyed being a two-dog household and didn't have to suffer the likes of Rambunctious Revi or Sassy Seuss!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
