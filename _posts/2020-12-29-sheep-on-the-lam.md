Hi,

So, after several days of relaxation and low stress, today was different. 

I had just finished my lunchtime Zoom yoga class, when Chris asked if I was feeling relaxed. After replying with slight trepidation that yes, I was all recently zen, he said "Well, it's just that you might not be after I tell you the sheep are out. Like out, out."  Upon further investigation, indeed the sheep had escaped our yard and were milling about the cars. With feelings of relaxation quickly giving way to a flood of adrenaline, I went outside as calmly as possible with my pail of oats to call the sheep back to the safety of the yard. But you know how animals know when you're faking it? Well these sheep heard the hysteria in my voice from miles away and they weren't about to come near me for all the oats in the world. After a bit of pretending like they might consider following me back into the yard, they finally decided to try their tiny hooves on the open road and they headed down the driveway at a good clip. After seeing their cute little sheep butts trotting off into the distance, I went inside and heated up some lunch. I was quite confident that we would never see them again, and even if we did, there would be nothing we could do to recapture them, short of finding some cowboy who could lasso us one to lead the others home with. Lacking any such cowboys in the vicinity, I felt quite fatalistic about their departure. I imagined sightings of our sheep being reported on the Innisfree facebook group. Perhaps they would become local folklore or we would run into them sometimes on our dog walks? Luckily for the sheep, and I suppose grudgingly for me, Chris was a little more optimistic, and I can say that the sheep are all back in their pen tonight. However, I am tired and I fear I will not do the story of their return justice, so I will have to leave it until tomorrow's email. 

But, I can leave you with today's photo, which is of me walking down the road with a pail of oats, singing to the sheep, as Chris follows in Chaser shepherding them from behind.

Hugs,
Hannah
