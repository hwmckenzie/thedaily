Hi!

Even though I haven't been writing my daily emails, the days here continue to be eventful.

Our basement chickens continue to improve. In fact, we returned one of the leghorns to the coop today. She spent the day in a small pen where everyone could get reacquainted without any pecking, and then tonight when everyone went to bed we put her on the roost. Hopefully when they all wake up together tomorrow morning everything will be hunky dory! We are looking forward to having a chicken-free basement again, though having them in the house has provided some entertainment. After we bath their butts, Chris sits with them on the couch while I clean their kennels. Sometimes Seuss observes. He is very interested in the chickens. Revi prefers the sheep. Speaking of the sheep, they have started practicing gymnastics. A few days ago, while gazing out the window between working, I noticed that there was a sheep standing on top of the round bale. Apparently the hay must taste better up there? That sheep clearly shared the good reviews with her friends as today when I looked out the window, three out of the five sheep were on top of the bale, munching away!

Today's photo is of the rooster demonstrating where he would like to have a new walkway installed. As he pointed out, the location is perfect for looking out the window and for watching over all his ladies.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
