Hi,

After "zooming" all day at the dog training conference over the weekend, I had to take a bit of a break from my computer. But, I am back!

Yesterday Chris flew his drone and took some video of our property. I am planning to use the footage to create a narrated bird's eye view tour for my permaculture property writing. I'm glad we did it yesterday as it was nice and sunny, whereas today was overcast and snowy. Surprisingly, the sheep seemed more curious about the drone than afraid of it, though Chris was still careful not to get too close to them while flying by. They would never forgive us! I'm not sure what the chickens thought. Although it has warmed up enough that we are opening their door during the day again, they seem to have lost their interest in the great outdoors for the time being. Their interior lifestyle may be causing a few problems though, as Chris found an eaten egg in the nest boxes for three days in a row. We don't know which chicken is doing it, and we're hoping she doesn't teach the others. No eggs were eaten today though, so fingers crossed!

I have started to think about the 2021 vegetable garden. Marlene is planning hers and has offered to start some seedlings for us. In Alberta, having many veggies started under lights in March is a must to get a harvest of more than just leaves before the frost arrives. Although, with Canadian rodents of note predicting an early spring, perhaps the growing season will be longer than usual this year. In my mind I envision an expansion and improvement from last year, but I will try to restrain myself! 

Today's photo is from one of our trail cameras. I'm not sure what phenomenon is causing the effect, but the trees look like they are decorated with little lights! I thought it was so magical I wanted to share it.

Hugs<br />
Hannah
