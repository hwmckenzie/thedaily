Hi there!

This morning started out with a bit of excitement as Tammi and Revi shot out the door, as they usually do, but then kept right on going! Being a little slow off the mark, I wasn't able to call them back before it was too late and all that was left of them was a few rustling branches to mark their passage. We did meet up with them again not too long down the path, and were left wondering what had grabbed their interest. We didn't have to wonder too long. Chris had set one of our trail cameras over our compost, and it captured a fisher checking out the scraps mere moments before Revi and Tammi arrived on scene. This does not bode well for our perspective chickens.... or our dogs should they corner the fisher! There may need to be some modifications to our composting plans in the future.

I also forgot to mention in yesterday's email that in addition to the shrike and blue jays, I also saw my first two robins of the year. So, all is right with the world, at least as far as the arrival of spring in concerned!

Chris and I signed up for a 2 month permaculture course online today following our webinar yesterday. There are lectures three evenings a week and it even has homework and a final project! I guess this represents both a blessing and a curse brought on by the covid situation. Everyone is putting tons of content and opportunities online, meaning we have access to way more opportunities than we did before, but at the same time, it is easy to become overwhelmed by all the things one could be learning about!

Today's photo is of our morning visitor.

Hugs,
Hannah
