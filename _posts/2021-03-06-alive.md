Hi,

I've noticed some more signs of spring. The tips of the dogwoods are turning bright red. I read today that this is caused by anthocyanins. These are pigments present in plant cells which vary depending on sunlight. As the sunlight increases in the spring, the branches get redder. Anthocyanin pigments can appear red, purple, blue or black depending on their pH, and many foods derive their coloration from anthocyanins including blueberries and raspberries. Anthocyanins have also been bred into some crops to produce novel colors, such as the purple cauliflower! Also, the dogs, while not turning red, are shedding more. So it must be spring!

Today's photo is of one of the eggs after one week in the incubator. We looked at the eggs with a light and confirmed the beginnings of life in all but the one from our coop. We left it in there just in case it was a late bloomer, but it seems more likely that it was not fertilized. Perhaps our rooster needs to work harder! 

Hugs<br />
Hannah
