Hi,

I have to give credit for my email title to Lea, our chicken mentor. This was her response to the arrival of our chickens yesterday, and I quite enjoyed it!

Today was our first full day with our chickens. We were a little anxious this morning when we peeked in the van (it got cold overnight!), but everyone survived the night, so we breathed a sigh of relief. After walking the dogs, we set the chickens up in the their temporary dog run, now improved with additional straw bales and the dog crate covered in a blanket, though they still preferred their cardboard box, of course! Everyone taken care of, we set to work on the coop, which I am starting to think is more of a chicken palace! With most of the framing done and the walls cut, the goal for today was painting the inside. Since we were reusing some old plywood, Chris took on the sanding to prep it and I did the painting. It was a gorgeous day, and we are now both slightly sun and windburnt. After lunch we went to check on the chickens and were surprised to find two eggs, one normal sized and one on the smaller side. We were quite surprised as we figured it would take them a little while to start laying after all the disruption of traveling and then sleeping in a van! We are hoping that by tomorrow night they will be all settled into their new coop. Then things can return to normal and Chris and I can catch up on all the things we haven't been doing while all this coop building has been going on.

Today's photo is of Tammi enjoying her new chicken TV.

Hugs,
Hannah
