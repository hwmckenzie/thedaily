Hi,

After a snowy and chilly weekend, today felt like a taste of spring! It got up to -3C and the sun was nice and strong so I got to listen to water melting and dripping outside while I worked at my desk in the afternoon. Also, another good sign is that one of our seeds sprouted! We started some vegetable seeds about 1 week ago. I was starting to worry that they might feel they were started in the wrong season, but after today I am feeling more optimistic that our garden will be ready when they are.

Since the weather was so nice, the dogs and I took an extra long walk this afternoon, and now we are all very tired. I have been trying to get a good photo of Tammi over the last few days to round out the latest series of dog photos. So far she has proven to be a challenging subject due to her dark color obscuring the fact that she has eyes, and also her coy nature when it comes to avoiding the camera! Maybe tomorrow I will have a good one of Tammi for you. Alas, tonight you will have to make do with one of yours truly trying to rescue Seuss's frisbee from under the deck, as he does his best to (not) assist the process, after of course being the one who put it there! You can thank Chris for capturing this particular angle!

Hugs,
Hannah
