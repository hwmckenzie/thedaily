To welcome in December, this evening Chris and I made a wreath. After work we took the dogs for a walk and foraged some grasses, branches, and other bits of the prairie from our property. The dogs were a bit naughty and insisted on racing to and fro in pursuit of all the scents of the wilds. Even (Old Lady) Sadie ran off for a little bit! As a result I had to do (quite) a bit of yelling, which was interspersed with holding the bag open so Chris could deposit bits of vegetation into it. But, everyone made it back to our gate at the same time, so all ended well! That being said, Seuss and Revi are both quite stiff already, so clearly they overdid it. They don't believe in moderation.

We then settled in with nachos and eggnog (with rum!) to assemble our wreath. Based on some advice from the internet, we began by fashioning a frame from an old tomato cage. Well, actually the internet suggested buying the frame, but what's the fun in that?! We then proceeded to make some "bouquets" of similar style, and finally to attach them to the frame. We added a few special accents and voila, a prairie wreath! It was a bit of a delicate process, particularly since some of the vegetation had thorns, but I am quite impressed with our finished product! 

Today's photo is of our homemade wreath. We are enjoying it inside tonight, but will put it outside before bed as we think it will last longer that way. I expect we'll hang it on the chicken coop door tomorrow.

Hugs,<br />
