Jaxx came to live with us just before Christmas and passed away this morning. This post is for him. 

Before Jaxx came to live with us as a foster, I imagine his life was like a fairy tale written by the Brothers Grimm. No Disney story here. He was missing an eye, the tip of his tail, and had something very wrong with his hind end. The vet estimated that he had been walking around with torn tendons in both of his knees for several years, which had resulted in some truly awful arthritis in addition to the original injury. But this isn't about Before. Jaxx is a dog, so this is about Now.

Jaxx had a playful streak. During his stay he and Riblet had many play sessions in the yard that were truly heartwarming to watch. He loved balls. He would drop his ball off the couch over and over again, and could snatch it out of the air amazingly fast for a dog with one eye! Sticks were also a big hit. At the end of our walk he would often grab a stick and prance around tossing his head in the air. He was also very good at keep-away, both with toys and with himself when he didn't want to come inside.

For the three and a half weeks Jaxx lived with us he joined in our daily routines. He came on our walks, reduced in length and difficulty to keep him comfy. He enjoyed meal times and nap times. He joined us on trips to Vegreville. He slept on the couch. He opened Christmas presents and ate lots of treats. He barked with everyone at things in the night. He got butt scratches, belly scratches and head scratches. He was loved.

Last week Chris took Jaxx to Edmonton for two days to be assessed by a behaviourist and to get a second opinion on his knees. Although he was always friendly with us, he could be touchy with others. Sadly, the outlook was not good. Jaxx really needed people to help him recover from the double knee surgery his was facing (which might not even improve his quality of life due to the debilitating arthritis), and to work with him through behaviour training to help him learn that despite his previous experiences, most people were friendly and could be trusted. As much as we wanted to be, Chris and I couldn't be Jaxx's people. Jaxx and Seuss took an instant dislike to each other and always needed to be separate. For those who know what our little cabin is like, you can imagine the logistics involved. No matter how many different ways we tried to look at it, we couldn't give Jaxx what he needed, and there was no back up option. 

So Chris brought Jaxx home and we tried our best to give him one last good weekend. We had a movie night in the office with just us and Jaxx. We watched Oceans Thirteen using the projector Sandy got us for Christmas a few years ago and Jaxx pulled the stuffing out of toys and chewed on a bone. At the end of the movie there were fireworks and Jax sat up in front of the projector so that the fireworks were dancing all across his face. That is one of the ways I will always remember Jaxx. We went on our usual walks and he played with Riblet. On our last night we watched a movie together with all the dogs. We chose Bolt, an animated movie about a dog who traveled across America to try to find his human and made friends and learned things about himself along the way. This morning after our walk and breakfast, our vet came to the house to help us say goodbye to Jaxx. Everyone except Seuss was with him until the sedation kicked in, and then Chris sat with him while our vet administered the last drug. It was very peaceful. But still... I like to believe that it was the humane thing to do, but part of me wonders if it was just the easier thing for us. The only true thing I can hang on to is that we did our best for Jaxx in the short time we had him. Now he is heading out into the universe, pain and fear free, to join the wild pack of dogs who have cut their ties to the earth, but not the bonds with the humans they loved. I hope Jaxx counts Chris and I in that number and comes back to check up on us sometimes. 

Jaxx. Jaxxie Jaxx. Jaxxie Ju. Jaxx-a-Roo. Jackson. Action Jackson. Jaxx-a-Snacks. Funny how it is so easy to come up with so many ways to talk to a dog, even in a short time.

Hugs,<br />
